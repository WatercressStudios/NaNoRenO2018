    #note: May is pronounced like 'my'

    eli "Okay, Eli, relax. This isn't something you haven't done before."

    eli "Well, I guess it is? Regardless..."

    eli "Just… just breathe, okay? Slow down, stop thinking, and act natural. That's all you have to do."

    eli "Things will be okay. They’ll end up… okay. They always do. The world's a good place, and you're a good man."

    eli "Nothing will go wrong."

    eli "Breathe. Relax."

    "I lean against the tall tree next to me, my winter coat padding my shoulder from the rough bark. It's a nice, large, and sturdy - as it always has been."

    "Here, amid the picturesque snow... this is where I plan on confessing to Maya, my childhood friend."

    "It's almost {i}too{/i} picturesque. Confessing to the love of your life underneath a tree in the snow? I'm sure she'll poke and prod at me, calling me cliche. Hell, we're in our {i}twenties{/i} for Christ's sake."

    "But, she'll laugh, and I'll laugh, and everything will end up a-okay."

    eli "I guess I need to rehearse some more, right? Just, what, ten more minutes until she's here?"

    eli "Right."

    "I slap myself around a bit with my mitts, amping up. I close my eyes in anticipation."

    eli "Let's do this."

    "Breathing in through my nose and slowly out through my mouth, the world around me disappears; it's just me and the tree."

    "I open my eyes, staring at its bark, noting how beautiful it looks in the white landscape."

    "Blushing a bit, I look away; my nerves are getting to me again."

    eli "Soooo… Tree, fancy meeting you here."

    eli "I'm sorry for the short note I-- uh, I mean notice! Sorry for the late notice, I know it's cold and you've been sitting here for--"

    "How old is this tree again?"

    eli "...Probably a few hundred years, now that I think about it. Anyway, not the point! I shouldn't comment on a tree's age, right?"

    eli "So... Tree, in all of your oaky splendor, I…"

    eli "I've never really liked other girls, ya know? You'd always joke about how much of a bachelor I am, and how I can get any girl that I wanted--"

    eli "Wait."

    eli "Ooooh. Oh. {i}Oh!{/i} So that's why you used to say that."


    eli "The only girl I've ever wanted was you."

    may "Is that so?"

    #show maya

    eli "Wait, May! It's not what it looks like, I swear!"

    may "Taking the whole \”Sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G\” thing to a whole new level, aren't you?"

    eli "I, wait, no, I'm not actually--"

    may "To think I'd be beat out by a tree. I'm happy for you two. You'll be a great couple!"

    eli "May, I promise that I'm not falling for the tree. There's nothing between us, no chemistry!"

    may "I dunno, the way you look at her? There's gotta be something there."

    eli "We're just friends! I promise. How would that even work?"

    may "Knowing you, you'd find a way. You're good like that."

    eli "I am? But I don't even {i}like{/i} trees."

    may "What? Trees are great!"

    eli "Well, yeah, but--"

    may "Oooh, you don't like {i}trees{/i}, huh?"

    eli "What?"

    may "I knew you were a bachelor, but I'd never have thought you'd be a {i}confirmed{/i} bachelor."

    eli "Wait."

    may "Thinking back on it, I guess it doesn't surprise me."

    eli "May, please, I can explain! I don't like {i}this{/i} tree, but other trees are rather attractive, I promise!"

    may "Oh? What kind of trees?"

    eli "Ones that are cute, and, uh…"

    may "Go on."

    eli "Ones that like to joke around. Ones that, uh, are beautiful, and funny - ones that are always there for me. Ones that forget to wear scarves on cold days."

    "It's true, May is shivering; her coat isn’t quite enough to keep her warm - so I grab mine, pull it off, and wringing it with my hands."

    "I'm really about to do this, huh?"

    may "Is that all? Any other juicy details you wanna te--"

    "I startle her, wrapping my scarf around her neck and bringing her close."

    "I hold her against me, wrapping my arm around her head, and I whisper into her ear."

    eli "You know, trees are constantly being chopped down. The Amazon Rainforest is at a critically low density. I figured that I'd find myself a tree before they're all gone."

    may "I-- wow, you sure know how to, what, {i}warm my globe?{/i} God, that sounds terrifying."

    #Laughing Voice lines from both May and Eli

    "Maya starts to giggle, then explodes in laughter; I'm quick to follow."

    may "What the fuck does that even {i}mean?{/i}"

    eli "I really don't know, you weirdo."

    may "No, {i}you're{/i} the weird one. If I hadn't come as early as I did, you'd be making out with an oak tree, of all things!"

    eli "Jealous?"

    may "A little."

    "A pang hits my stomach. Maybe I should start over and confess to her for real? I may have ruined the initial attempt, but she'd probably want one nonetheless."

    "I pull back slightly, holding her face in my mitts, looking directly into her eyes..."

    eli "Well. Maya, I have something I've wanted to tell you for a long time."

    "Maya remains quiet in anticipation - her mouth slightly agape as her eyes widen. I'm sure she's expected this, but she's in awe nonetheless."

    eli "You see, I've never really liked any of the other girls."

    "My heart beats, and I feel hers resonate with it."

    eli "You used to say that I could have any girl that I wanted."

    "Her eyes water, and she begins to smile."

    eli "The only girl I've ever wanted was you, May."

    "The snow deafens the sounds of the city, holding the weight of my words for itself, ensuring that Maya and I are truly alone together."

    may "That's…" 

    "Wiping away at her eyes, May looks at me with an odd expression."

    may "That's really cliche, you know."

    eli "Yeah, well, I'm not really that good at this type of stuff."

    may "It's okay, Eli. I love you for it, and I always will."

    "It's her turn to bring me in for a hug, nuzzling close."

    may "You're a good person, Eli. I hope you know that."

    eli "...Is that a yes?"

    "She pulls away from me, pouting."

    may "Of course it is! I could never say no to you; you know this."

    eli "Yeah, true. That's why you agreed to meet me out here in the cold. I'm sorry, you've got to be super cold right now, aren't you? I should've chosen a better spot, or waited until it wasn't so cold, or maybe--"

    "May holds a finger up to my lips, silencing me."

    may "Stop, Eli. Don't say sorry for making a girl happy, okay? You can make it up to me with some coffee, how about that?"

    eli "Deal."

    "I still feel bad, but she's right." 

    "I lose myself in her eyes for a few minutes; the two of us stare at each other in bliss. A huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders, and I feel invincible."

    eli "Oh! I almost forgot, I got you flowers!"

    may "I saw! Plastic, just how I like them!"

    eli "Yeah. Since you're allergic to most, I figured this was the next best thing."

    may "You worry too much. Don't worry, I love it. Super thoughtful, as always, Eli."

    "She brings me into another embrace, and then she grabs my hand. She motions towards the cafe, and I begin to walk with her."

    "Today's going to be a good day, a happy day. For both of us."
