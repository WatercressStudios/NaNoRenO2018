    eli "May, why did we have to run?"

    "The sweet old couple in front of us seem just as startled by our sudden appearance."

    # slightly out of breath
    may "We’d like to buy a kite, please."

    "Huh? What is she saying? This isn’t a shop - and it doesn’t even seem like they know us!"

    may "A kite like that one!"

    "Maya’s pointing at an old-style cloth kite by the window. It looks battered, like it’s been sewn together in pspots."

    "Does that kite even fly? Why would Maya want that one?"

    "For some reason, the old man isn’t phased by Maya’s strange request. Instead, he steps into his garage and produces a large cloth kite that looks exactly like the one Maya pointed at, only brand new."

    "Maya tries to open her wallet - but the old man stops her."

    may "Are you sure?"

    om "Of course. She’s never flown before, so you’ll be doing us a favor."

    ow "Be sure to make some good memories with it."

    may "Thank you!"

    may "{i}Come on, Eli!{/i}"

    eli "Ack, slow down!"

    may "Here, let me hold the kite. Take the spool and go thirty feet in that direction. Keep the line taut!"

    eli "Okay, but since when do you know how to fly kites?"

    may "I don’t. I’m looking it up right now."

    "Wait, what?"

    "I turn around and see that she’s pulled her gloves off to use her phone. She’s serious?"

    "Who are you and what have you done to my Maya!?"

    may "Okay, here’s the deal: when you feel the breeze on your back, pull the line and I’ll toss the kite up. We have to do this at the same time, so pay attention!"

    eli "Wait, when you say \"pull,\" how much are we talking--"

    may "There’s a breeze! Do it now!"

    eli "Huh!?"

    "Before I can ask for a timeout, Maya tosses the kite up into the air!"

    "Oh crap!"

    "I pull the line, but I’m too late. The kite flops lamely onto the ground."

    eli "Shit, sorry--"

    may "One more time!"

    "Without missing a beat, Maya lifts the kite up and gets into position. She’s really into this!"

    "I guess I should take this seriously as well."

    "So, I mentally prepare myself and I wait… until I feel a breeze on my back."

    eli "Now!"

    "I quickly pull on the line. This time I can feel a strangely satisfying resistance - and before I know it, the kite starts to rise high into the orange sky."

    eli "Holy shit, it’s going up! It’s {i}actually{/i} going up!"

    may "Don’t stop! You have to keep pulling!"

    eli "Are you sure? It’s flying!"

    may "Yes! Do it!"

    "I pull more of the line in - and as if the connection to me is all it needed, the kite starts soaring even higher."

    eli "Oh my god, this is {i}freaking amazing!{/i}"

    "Maya runs over and nearly knocks me over with her hug."

    eli "Ooph!"

    "The spool slips from my hands and the kite glides away into the trees."

    eli "Oh shit, the kite! Wait here, I’ll get--"

    may "Leave it."
