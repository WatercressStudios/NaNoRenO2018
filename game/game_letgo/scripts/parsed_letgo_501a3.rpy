    voice "C-501a3-5.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "A kite like that one!"

    "Maya’s pointing at an old-style cloth kite by the window. It looks battered, like it’s been sewn together in pspots."

    "Does that kite even fly? Why would Maya want that one?"

    "For some reason, the old man isn’t phased by Maya’s strange request. Instead, he steps into his garage and produces a large cloth kite that looks exactly like the one Maya pointed at, only brand new."

    "Maya tries to open her wallet - but the old man stops her."

    voice "C-501a3-21.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
