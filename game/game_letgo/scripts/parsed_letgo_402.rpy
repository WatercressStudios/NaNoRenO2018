    "Lunging forward, she kisses me. Her arms wrap around my chest, and she desperately squeezes me tight."

    "The moment is a long one, with her cold lips on mine - but it isn't quite passionate."

    "This was born of sadness, nothing positive. I feel her love - but it's dim, cold, distant. Her heart was broken the second I told her what she needed to do."

    "I think that's why she brought me here. She knew the answer already, but wanted me to tell her that she was wrong."

    "But, honestly? I don't think she is."

    "My own mortality hasn't really dawned on me yet. I really don't care about my death - at least, not as much as I care about her life."

    "If she's experiencing this - and if this is the right answer - then she's going to have to live with the fact that she couldn't save me."

    "Jesus, what type of feeling is that? Helplessness? That no matter what you do, you {i}cannot{/i} win?"

    "Is destiny really out of her hands? Is the world truly a dark place, where nothing will go right and everything is upside down?"

    "Has May really {i}failed?{/i}"

    "Hugging her tight, kissing back, I try to lose myself in this moment."

    "I started today hoping that I'd be able to live my entire life with her."

    "I guess I got my wish."

    "She warms up a bit, and her shaking subsides. Her sobbing quiets - and in the end, everything is silent."

    "The world around us melts away."

    "It's just Maya and Elijah."

    "She pulls back, gasping for air, finally calm enough to sit still."

    voice "C-402-1.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "What am I going to do without you?"

    voice "C-402-2.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "What you've always done. You're going to live. I mean it; don't just survive."

    "She nods, falling back against her bed."

    voice "C-402-3.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "I love you, Eli."

    voice "C-402-4.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "I love you too, May."

    "The atmosphere subtly changes. It's no longer dark…"

    "Dim, sure, but not dark."

    "With lethargic movements, she grabs her phone and now-drinkable tea."

    "Leaning up towards me, she gives me a sad look."

    voice "C-402-5.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "This is around the time you usually die."

    "I have no response but to nod."

    "Right. I should get going."

    voice "C-402-6.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Promise me something, May. Promise me that you won't have to watch me die again."

    "Staring at me, she shakes her head and squeezes her eyes shut to keep the tears away."

    voice "C-402-7.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "No, of course not."

    "Now I must walk away from the one I love." 

    "Standing up, each footstep I take is thunderous - each movement strained. I now realize that this may be the last time I ever get to see her."

    voice "C-402-8.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "Hey, Eli?"

    "I turn back to her, now at her door."

    voice "C-402-9.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "...Thank you for the flowers."

    "..."

    "There's a near-infinite amount of things she could have said in this moment, but she comments on them."

    "That's right."

    "Even after I'm gone, they'll keep her company."

    "I hope this is a sign that she'll be able to move on."

    "While that's an eventuality that hurts, my desire for her to find happiness outweighs this sadness."

    voice "C-402-10.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "I'll be waiting for you - and please, remember that I'm a patient man."

    voice "C-402-11.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "I want to see you again, when it's the right time."

    voice "C-402-12.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Goodbye, Maya."

    "With that, I turn my back on her and leave her behind."

    "So this is the end, huh?"

    "What am I going to do in my last moments? Where am I going to go?"

    "Whenever I was asked what I’d do if I knew I was going to die, I'd always answer something simple, like \"enjoy it with my friends and family.\""

    "But that's not an option now, is it?"

    "I guess I'll go to a place that I've always loved - a little piece of nature, where I fed the ducks with May shortly after we met."

    "In time, I reach the park and the bench that we used to share growing up…"

    "If this weren't wintertime, I'd hear birds chirping, dogs barking, children playing near the park, and their parents yelling after them."

    "But it's dead now. The snow swallows my words - keeps my thoughts close to me. Sound doesn't travel as far in the void, and the park is completely silent."

    "The bench is cold and wet, but I don't really care."

    "It supports my back well enough - and it offers a good place to lean against. I spread all of my limbs out and enjoy the wiggle-room."

    "I'm alone. Should I say my goodbyes?"

    "No… everyone would probably get the wrong idea."

    "The sun sets over the pond - and the moon peeks out from behind the clouds, white as snow."

    "A slight wind runs through my clothes, but I pay it no mind. I'm already numb."

    "So this is what peace is like, huh?"

    "A completely quiet night, in a little park, with nothing but the stars to keep me company."

    "I still find myself doubting May’s words, but she would never lie to me about something so important."

    "Like I thought before, I trust her."

    "Whoever or whatever decided to put May in this situation, you can go fuck yourself!"

    "But... I'm also in your debt."

    "It's traumatizing for her, but you did it for a reason, right?"

    "Whatever would have happened otherwise must've been infinitely worse."

    "Having a good idea of what {i}that{/i} is, I don't really want to think about it."

    "With the sun completely settled underneath the horizon, I begin to nod off."

    "The darkness definitely helps soothe me into a deep, deep sleep."

    "Everything around me minimizes, and my worldly worries dissipate."

    "With one last smile, I'm gone."
