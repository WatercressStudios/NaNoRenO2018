    "Her face is still buried in the front of my green jacket, and it doesn’t seem like she’s letting go."

    eli "Maya?"

    "I’m not sure what’s going on, but I wrap my arms around her shoulders and gently kiss the top of her head. She hugs me tighter in response."

    may "I love you, Eli."

    "I can feel happiness bloom in my chest again."

    "Yet, something is gnawing at me; something’s out of place, but I can’t put a finger on it."

    eli "I love you too."

    "We stay like this for several minutes. Neither of us want to move - and eventually, Maya steps back. Her large brown eyes are glistening in the sunset."

    eli "May, what’s wrong?"

    "She gently shakes her head and wipes away some tears with the back of her gloved hand."

    may "Nothing. I’m just happy, that’s all."

    "I start thinking about how my day started: the practice confessions, finally becoming a couple after so many years, our first real date…" 

    "It’s been so fun - even more than usual! I’m so glad we finally told each other how we feel."

    eli "I’m happy, too. Maybe the happiest I’ve ever been."

    may "..."

    may "I’m glad you said that, Eli."

    may "It’s all I want."

    "After a moment of silence, she takes my hands."

    may "But it’s time for me to go."

    eli "Oh… made plans for tonight?"

    may "Something like that. I’ve… got a promise to keep."

    # VA: understandingly
    eli "I get it."

    eli "We always keep our promises."

    may "Always."

    "I squeeze her hands. I don’t know what’s gotten over me, but I can’t stop the next words from spilling out of my mouth."

    eli "Today’s the best day of my life, May."

    "She looks surprised - more than that, she looks like she’s trying to hold back tears."

    # VA: voice breaking
    may "It’s the best day of mine too."

    eli "May? Are you sure you’re okay?"

    may "Yeah, thanks to you."

    "Huh? What does that mean? Before I can ask her, she releases my hands and takes a step back."

    may "I’ll never forget today. Thank you, Eli… and goodbye."

    "I blink. Okay, she’s {i}definitely{/i} being weird. More than anything, I want to find out what’s wrong - but for some reason... I let it go."

    eli "I’ll call you tomorrow."

    "Maya looks away for a few seconds before responding."

    may "I look forward to it."

    "With that, she turns around and leaves."

    "When she’s out of sight, I turn towards the night sky and close my eyes."

    "I made a lot of good memories today."

    "Standing in the middle of the park, surrounded by snow and trees, I let myself dream of them..."

    # TODO: CREDITS
    # I’m thinking credits should be each significant scene or CG + our names
    # definitely with a 1 min sentimental music track (are we sure it can’t be with vocals?)
