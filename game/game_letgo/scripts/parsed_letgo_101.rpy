    "I lean against the tall tree next to me, my winter coat padding my shoulder from the rough bark. It's a nice, large, and sturdy - as it always has been."

    "Here, amid the picturesque snow... this is where I plan on confessing to Maya, my childhood friend."

    "It's almost {i}too{/i} picturesque. Confessing to the love of your life underneath a tree in the snow? I'm sure she'll poke and prod at me, calling me cliche. Hell, we're in our {i}twenties{/i} for Christ's sake."

    "But, she'll laugh, and I'll laugh, and everything will end up a-okay."

    voice "C-101-8.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Right."

    voice "C-101-9.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Let's do this."

    "Breathing in through my nose and slowly out through my mouth, the world around me disappears; it's just me and the tree."

    "I open my eyes, staring at its bark, noting how beautiful it looks in the white landscape."

    "Blushing a bit, I look away; my nerves are getting to me again."

    voice "C-101-10.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)

    voice "C-101-11.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)

    voice "C-101-12.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "...Probably a few hundred years, now that I think about it. Anyway, not the point! I shouldn't comment on a tree's age, right?"

    voice "C-101-13.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "So... Tree, in all of your oaky splendor, I…"

    voice "C-101-14.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "I've never really liked other girls, ya know? You'd always joke about how much of a bachelor I am, and how I can get any girl that I wanted--"

    voice "C-101-15.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Wait."

    voice "C-101-16.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)

    voice "C-101-39.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Ones that like to joke around. Ones that, uh, are beautiful, and funny - ones that are always there for me. Ones that forget to wear scarves on cold days."

    "It's true, May is shivering; her coat isn’t quite enough to keep her warm - so I grab mine, pull it off, and wringing it with my hands."

    "I'm really about to do this, huh?"

    voice "C-101-40.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "Is that all? Any other juicy details you wanna te--"

    "I startle her, wrapping my scarf around her neck and bringing her close."

    "I hold her against me, wrapping my arm around her head, and I whisper into her ear."

    voice "C-101-41.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "You know, trees are constantly being chopped down. The Amazon Rainforest is at a critically low density. I figured that I'd find myself a tree before they're all gone."

    voice "C-101-46.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Jealous?"

    voice "C-101-47.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "A little."

    "A pang hits my stomach. Maybe I should start over and confess to her for real? I may have ruined the initial attempt, but she'd probably want one nonetheless."

    "I pull back slightly, holding her face in my mitts, looking directly into her eyes..."

    voice "C-101-48.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Well. Maya, I have something I've wanted to tell you for a long time."

    "Maya remains quiet in anticipation - her mouth slightly agape as her eyes widen. I'm sure she's expected this, but she's in awe nonetheless."

    voice "C-101-49.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "You see, I've never really liked any of the other girls."

    voice "C-101-51.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "The only girl I've ever wanted was you, May."

    "The snow deafens the sounds of the city, holding the weight of my words for itself, ensuring that Maya and I are truly alone together."

    voice "C-101-52.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "That's…" 

    "Wiping away at her eyes, May looks at me with an odd expression."

    voice "C-101-53.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "That's really cliche, you know."

    voice "C-101-54.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Yeah, well, I'm not really that good at this type of stuff."

    voice "C-101-55.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "It's okay, Eli. I love you for it, and I always will."

    "It's her turn to bring me in for a hug, nuzzling close."

    voice "C-101-56.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "You're a good person, Eli. I hope you know that."

    voice "C-101-57.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "...Is that a yes?"

    "She pulls away from me, pouting."

    voice "C-101-58.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "Of course it is! I could never say no to you; you know this."

    voice "C-101-59.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Yeah, true. That's why you agreed to meet me out here in the cold. I'm sorry, you've got to be super cold right now, aren't you? I should've chosen a better spot, or waited until it wasn't so cold, or maybe--"

    "May holds a finger up to my lips, silencing me."

    voice "C-101-60.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "Stop, Eli. Don't say sorry for making a girl happy, okay? You can make it up to me with some coffee, how about that?"

    voice "C-101-61.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Deal."

    "I still feel bad, but she's right." 

    "I lose myself in her eyes for a few minutes; the two of us stare at each other in bliss. A huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders, and I feel invincible."

    voice "C-101-62.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Oh! I almost forgot, I got you flowers!"

    voice "C-101-63.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "I saw! Plastic, just how I like them!"

    voice "C-101-64.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Yeah. Since you're allergic to most, I figured this was the next best thing."

    voice "C-101-65.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "You worry too much. Don't worry, I love it. Super thoughtful, as always, Eli."

    "She brings me into another embrace, and then she grabs my hand. She motions towards the cafe, and I begin to walk with her."

    "Today's going to be a good day, a happy day. For both of us."
