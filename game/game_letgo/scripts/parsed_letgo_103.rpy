    "We leave the cafe, talking lightly and generally enjoying each other’s company."

    "As we make our way along, we get close to the park we used to spend time in when we were younger."

    voice "C-103-1.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Hey, there’s our park."

    voice "C-103-2.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "Oh! Let’s go play on the swings!"

    voice "C-103-3.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Wait, but... it’s getting late! And cold!"

    "She’s already jogging to them when she looks over her shoulder to yell at me."

    voice "C-103-4.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "Come on! It’ll be fun, just like when we were kids!"

    "I hurry to catch up with her, my panting visible in the cold."

    "She brushes a little snow off a swing to sit."

    "In the fading light of sunset, her hair shines and she has a luminescence about her."

    voice "C-103-5.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "What are you staring at? Start pushing!"

    "She kicks her feet excitedly and I can’t help but laugh."

    voice "C-103-6.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Of course."

    "I stand behind her and grab the chains. Leaning back, I pull her up high and then let go."

    "She lets out a little shout, laughing and swinging."

    "Her hair blows in the wind, the scarf flying behind her when she moves forward."

    voice "C-103-7.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "You gotta swing with me! Come on!"

    voice "C-103-8.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "I’m pretty sure my legs are too long. My feet will scrape the ground."

    voice "C-103-9.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "Well, you gotta try!"

    voice "C-103-10.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Alright, alright, I’m going."

    "Sitting on the swing beside her, I bend my knees back and forth a bit; eventually, I gain a little momentum."

    voice "C-103-11.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "Is that all you got? Remember when we used to see who could swing the highest? But we were both going too hard to tell who was actually the winner."

    voice "C-103-12.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Yeah, there were a couple times where we were swinging so high I was worried about sliding off! It was worth it to beat you though."

    "She slows down to my level and I catch her eye with a smirk."

    voice "C-103-13.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "Yeah, yeah, okay. Just because your legs got longer doesn’t mean your ego should grow too. I won sometimes!"

    voice "C-103-14.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "And who do you think let that happen?"

    voice "C-103-15.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "What! That’s so unfair, ya know. All I was trying to do was impress you."

    voice "C-103-16.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Impress {i}me?{/i} I didn’t get that vibe at all."

    voice "C-103-17.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "Well, I think we’ve established you’re a little thick-headed."

    "Is this flirting?"

    "I should go along."

    "Right?"

    voice "C-103-18.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Thick-headed? What? I’m sorry, I couldn’t quite understand what you said."

    voice "C-103-19.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "See? You just can’t keep up."

    voice "C-103-20.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "I just didn’t notice, I guess - which is ridiculous, since I was always watching you."

    voice "C-103-21.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Well, n-not watching you! You were just always on my mind is all! You’ve {i}always{/i} been on my mind..."

    "Don’t make it weird! You’re okay..."

    "This is nice, just enjoy the time together."

    "Live in the moment; everything is going to be just… great. It’ll be great!"

    "She reaches over and pulls on the chain of my swing."

    voice "C-103-22.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "You’re on my mind too."

    voice "C-103-23.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "Wanna walk over to the lake with me? Watch the end of the sunset?"

    "It’s so captivating to look into her eyes."

    voice "C-103-24.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Yeah, that would be nice."

    "We walk over to the lake - and this time I actually take her hand. She slowly intertwines her fingers with mine and squeezes a little. It feels comfortable - {i}right{/i} - even through our gloves."

    "The short walk has the sun setting and the stars coming into focus instead."

    "We eventually arrive, and she finds a fallen tree to sit on."

    "I join her and we watch the water in silence for a while; it’s a calming silence, though - like this is how things are supposed to be."

    voice "C-103-25.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "The stars are coming out. They look nice."

    voice "C-103-26.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Yeah, they’re pretty clear tonight."

    voice "C-103-27.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "Eli, have you ever made a wish on a shooting star?"

    voice "C-103-28.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "No; the only wishes I’ve made were on birthday candles and wishing wells."

    voice "C-103-29.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "I feel like making one tonight."

    voice "C-103-30.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Well, birthday candles only work if it’s your birthday - and I don’t know of any wishing wells around here. But maybe we could throw something into the lake? I can find us some rocks or some leaves or--?"

    voice "C-103-31.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "Yeah, let’s do that."

    "She smiles warmly at me. I wonder what she would want to wish for."

    "We gather a few rocks and stand near the water’s edge, ready to throw."

    voice "C-103-32.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Well, you have to go first since it was your idea."

    voice "C-103-33.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "I don’t know what to wish for!"

    voice "C-103-34.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "But you’re the one who wanted to do that!"

    voice "C-103-35.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "I guess I just wanted to feel the magic, ya know? Like that’s the only thing that could make this night complete."

    voice "C-103-36.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Well, I don’t want to go first; I’m not ready yet either!"

    voice "C-103-37.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "How about we throw all of our rocks at the same time? Make all of our wishes at once, like a big wish made of little ones."

    voice "C-103-38.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "This is a little silly, you know. Maybe if these were coins and this was a well, or a fountain, or something."

    voice "C-103-39.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "Would you just close our eyes and make your wishes?"

    voice "C-103-40.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Okay, okay, let’s go."

    voice "C-103-41.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "Ready? Three… Two… One...!"

    "We both hurl a fistfull of pebbles into the water."

    "The splashes echo into the quiet night."

    "I wish for this to last forever..."
