    eli "I didn’t know you were {i}this{/i} into parks, May."

    may "What do you mean? We used to love this place!"

    eli "Yeah, in spring. Or summer. Or even fall. We don’t come here during winter."

    may "We were just here--"

    "A look of surprise flashes across her face - only to be replaced by a small, bittersweet smile."

    eli "May?"

    may "Nothing. I was just reliving some good memories."

    "I gently squeeze her hand and look around. The swingset by the tree, the ducks by the pond, the bench beneath the blue sky…"

    "This is perfect, just as I remember - and that perfection is only compounded by her warm hand." 

    eli "We’ve made quite a few of those, haven’t we?"

    may "You don’t know the half of it."

    "She said that so softly I barely heard it."

    may "Thank you, Eli."

    eli "Huh? Sure… I mean, thank you, May."

    "Something’s different about us. We’re normally so much more chatty than this. What happened to the usual back-and-forth teasing? Is it because we’re a couple now that we’re acting so strangely?"

    "Desperate to change the mood, I spot a couple of ducks huddled together by the pond."

    eli "Uhh, so… how about we get some bread to feed--"

    may "No, let’s not."

    eli "Huh?"

    # VA: happily
    may "Let’s do something different this time… I want to make a new memory!"

    eli "Oh?"

    may "Don’t you \"oh\" me. Help me think of something fun!"

    eli "But what about the cute baby ducklings? What if they’re starving?"

    may "They {i}never{/i} starve - have you seen how much people feed them!?"

    "I grin at her. I guess I was worried for nothing and we haven’t changed at all. The chemistry’s still there."

    eli "What did you have in mind?"

    "She cups her chin in her gloved hand and takes a moment to think. She’s {i}actually{/i} giving this some serious thought! I can’t help but to chuckle at her… What’s gotten into Maya?"

    eli "You know, there’s no pressure to do anything different today. We have the rest of our lives, after all."

    may "..."

    may "...Yeah."

    "I feel my cheeks burn. Oh shit, did I just say that? Did I really just declare that I..."

    eli "I’m not saying-- What I mean is..."

    "Wait, why am I backtracking? We’re a couple now. I can finally say these things out loud!"

    eli "What I mean is, I want us to grow old together, May."

    "Maya laughs and rests her head against my arm."

    may "Oh Eli, you’re such a dork."

    may "And yes… I... want to grow old together, too..."

    "There’s a strain in her voice - but I’m not sure why. Before I can ask her about it, she suddenly pulls back."

    # VA: gasp
    may "Ah! Grow old together! I have an idea! Come on, Eli!"

    "Her grip suddenly tightens and she starts pulling me away."

    eli "M-May!?"

    may "Hurry up, we can still make it!"

    "Whoa! She goes into a sprint. Still make what!?"
