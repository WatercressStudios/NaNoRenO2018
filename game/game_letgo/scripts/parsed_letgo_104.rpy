    "We eventually get up and start heading home."

    "The night was darkening, allowing the moon to come out and light the sidewalk beneath our feet."

    "The sounds of people in the different buildings we pass change the farther we go."

    "We’d normally go our separate ways soon, so now’s the time to say something."

    voice "C-104-1.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Can I walk you home tonight?"

    voice "C-104-2.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "Sure, I’d like that."

    "She smiles up at me and takes my hand."

    "Alright, now’s the best time. Try to remember what you were going to say at the tree, dammit!"

    "Everything’s alright, just explain how you feel - in full this time."

    "You know she has feelings for you too. Just ask her out or something!"

    "Keep things simple; don’t go full out..."

    "Or maybe I should spill it all? Tell her I love her more than life and would do anything for her?"

    "Is that coming on too strong? Is strong even good? Oh jeez, say something before we’re on her doorstep!"

    voice "C-104-3.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "So, Maya… Uhm, I guess I just wanted to clarify what happened earlier…"

    voice "C-104-4.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "You mean when you confessed your feelings for beautiful, funny trees that have always been there for you?"

    voice "C-104-5.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Yes, well.. uh, that. See, what I was trying to say was that I really care about you."

    voice "C-104-6.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "Oh really?"

    "I patiently wait for her to continue. My feet move on their own and I avoid eye contact."

    "Did I do something wrong?"

    "Should I have said it differently? The important thing is I said it, right? Or maybe it just wasn’t enough..."

    "Just calm down; focus on getting her home safely. Watch the sidewalk, watch the car moving this way, watch her eyelashes as she blinks in the bright headlights..."

    voice "C-104-7.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "All I can say is that I’ve only wanted you too. I guess I just never knew how to say--"

    "Before she can finish, the car catches some ice on the road."

    "Tires screech, and the lights dance."

    voice "C-104-8.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "Oh my god, watch out!"

    "The car hits the curb - then comes over the edge toward us."

    "I push Maya off to the left.."

    "The driver’s completely lost control."

    "I look over to see that Maya is on the ground a few feet away, trying to get up..."

    "The headlights are blinding."

    "It’s moving too fast."

    "Is Maya okay?"

    voice "C-104-9.mp3" #Elijah (Michael Potok)
    eli "Maya--"

    "The lights are everywhere."

    "And then, there’s nothing."
