    may "Oh, hey! We should head to a cafe downtown!"

    eli "Huh?"

    may "I mean, you promised me a coffee - and it’s our first date, right? Who needs to stick around here when we can start things off with a bang!"

    "That’ll cut into my pocket a bit more than I was expecting, but I guess she has a point. And she seems pretty into the idea, too!"

    eli "Alright. Got somewhere in mind?"

    may "Uh..."

    may "It’s downtown! There’s gotta be {i}something{/i} that’ll work."

    "I shrug. It’s a little strange for her to suggest something without an actual idea, but I don’t mind."

    eli "Alright, sure. Whatever y--"

    "In a flash, she grabs my hand."

    may "Great!"

    #I know damn well from Nano 2017 that having character sprites in a vehicle is impossible, so we should probably keep this to a black screen
    #or just don’t have sprites I guess

    "Soon enough, we get to another stop. I start to stand."

    may "No, wait! Not this one!"

    eli "Huh?"

    may "There’s... a place I want to check out!"

    eli "What happened to coffee?"

    may "I came up with something better!"

    eli "You did? What is it?"

    may "..."

    may "It’s a secret."

    eli "{i}Aaaalrighty…{/i} I’ll trust you."

    may "Guaranteed to be the best date we’ve ever had!"

    "We share a quick laugh."

    "At the next stop, May stands up."

    may "Alrighty! This should be good!"

    "We exit the bus, and..."

    "I crack a smile."

    eli "Oh, the hospital? Pretty out-there idea for a first date, May!"

    may "H-Huh!?"

    may "We’re not going to the hospital!"

    may "We’re going somewhere... {i}close{/i} to it!"

    may "O-Oh."

    may "Pull that again and I might have to send you to a hospital for real."

    eli "Ha! I’d like to see you try."

    "I squeeze her hand and we start walking."

    may "Ah, you aren’t so tough."

    eli "Oh yeah?"

    may "I could get the jump on you, no problem."

    eli "Not after you’ve said that, you can’t. I’ll keep an eye out."

    may "Hmm, got me there. Poison, maybe?"

    eli "I just won’t eat any food you give me."

    may "What!? {i}Never?{/i}"

    eli "Not ever."

    may "That’s gonna put a serious strain on our relationship, you know."

    eli "Haha~! Kinda, yeah."

    may "God, Eli. I never took you for the kinda guy who has to win every argument!"

    eli "Oh, yeah. I’m a real handful."

    may "What am I gonna do with you? If you’re gonna be that way, just imagine the fires we’d start if we tried to order a pizza!"

    eli "Your fault for liking pineapple."

    may "Ooooh, that’s low."

    eli "You were pretty much asking for it."
