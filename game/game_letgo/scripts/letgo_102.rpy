    "Our footsteps crunch in the snow together, our gloved hands shoved into our pockets. I’m tempted to hold hands with her - but if mine are this cold, God knows how cold hers are."

    "We make our way onto the sidewalk, passing houses and shops. It’s nice, spending time with her again."

    "Despite the confession and the comfortable walk, we find ourselves in an awkward silence."

    "This is par for the course, I guess."

    "Eventually, I elect for some smalltalk."

    eli "So, how was your Thanksgiving? Did your sisters come home?"

    may "Yeah, the usual family was there. They all asked about you."

    eli "Oh yeah? Me?"

    may "Yeah, just how you’ve been, that type of stuff."

    may "What about you, though? Eat a lot?"

    eli "Oh, you know me. I probably ate even more than last year, honestly. Everyone brought at least two casseroles and a pie - and there’s no way to not try everything."

    eli "Yeah, we were the same. My family asked about you too, actually. All the aunts were hoping to see you again."

    may "God, I miss them all so much. Last year was so much fun!"

    eli "It was definitely a full house, that’s for sure. Only one argument this year! I was surprised. Mom was pissed at Dad because he burnt the gravy. It worked out though ."

    may "B-Burnt it? Like, how?"

    eli "I know, right!? I didn’t even think that was possible."

    "I laugh a little nervously. Even though we’ve known each other for years, I suddenly feel like I don’t know how to be myself."

    "I keep thinking about standing under that tree."

    eli "Uhh, so you had a good time?"

    may "Yeah, I guess so! It can be a little stressful with the family. It’s oddly formal, ya know?"

    eli "Yeah, I guess that’s just how holidays work. Oh, here’s the cafe!"

    may "Why has it been so long since we’ve been here? I miss this place! Look at the little turkey in the window; what a cutie! Aww!"

    "He’s not the only cutie here."

    "As I pay for the coffees, Maya disappears to find a table. We settle down into some squishy armchairs and thoughtfully sip our drinks."

    "I wish I knew what she was thinking about. I’m caught up in looking at her."

    may "Remember when this place had just opened? We were walking around together."

    eli "And I wasn’t looking where I was going and ran right into the owner with that huge crate of milk?"

    may "And he stumbled and one of the milk jugs hit the ground and exploded?"

    "She’s smirking at me. Her eyes always light up so prettily."

    "Prettily? Is that a word?"

    eli "Uhh, what?"

    eli "Oh, yeah… Yeah! It was all over the street. He was way too nice about that."

    may "You know, if it were me, I would have yelled at you a little."

    "She smirks again."

    eli "Hey, that was an accident! It was third grade! And if I remember correctly, you ran into me! It’s not my fault you can’t walk right."

    may "I was nine!"

    eli "So was I, and I wasn’t yelling at you!"

    may "No, you just teared up a little is all."

    eli "You were taller than me! And very loud, thank you very much! You were kind of intimidating… and I felt bad!"

    may "Yeah, yeah, okay. Scared of a girl; I see how it is."

    eli "Girls are scary!"

    may "Is that why you never date?"

    eli "I mean, not exactly. Well actually. Uh, wait! That’s not a fair question. I just--"

    "She reaches out, gently touching my arm."

    may "It’s okay; we both know why you didn’t date anyone."

    "She gives me a wink."

    may "Anyway, I’m gonna run to the bathroom real quick. Don’t leave without me!"

    "She jumps out of her chair and walks away."

    eli "But we just got here… Huh?"

    "With her absence, I take a deep breath."

    "Is this a date? I should have made myself clear earlier. It just feels like normal."

    "Not that there’s anything wrong with that!"

    "But I don’t {i}want{/i} it to feel normal.."

    "Not that I want things to be weird!"

    "Jesus Christ, what am I doing? Maybe we can talk on the way home."

    "Yeah, that’s it: I’ll walk her home! Okay, just be cool, here she comes."

    may "Did I miss anything?"

    eli "Not that I know of? I finished my coffee. That guy over there sneezed."

    may "Ahh, wow, exactly what I wanted to know; perfect."

    eli "It’s an odd question to ask, okay?"

    may "You know exactly what I’m interested in: sneezing men."

    eli "What? Anyway! Now that I think on it, that must have been the day we met, wasn’t it? The dreaded milk incident?"

    may "No, we met the day before. You held the door for me on the way outside for recess."

    eli "Did I? Wow, a gentleman even then."

    may "Uh huh, sure.."

    "We laugh a little and I feel comfortable again."

    eli "So how has work been? Was it hard for you to get time off?"

    may "Oh, work is normal. Not looking forward to going back, but I think I just miss the family. Things have been a little busy because of the season."

    may "What about you?"

    eli "Work is just work, really. Same stuff, different day. I got the time off pretty easily."

    may "That’s good!"

    "We pause and sip our coffees. Her cheeks look flushed."

    eli "Are you warm? Did you want me to get us some water or something?"

    may "Oh, what? No no, I’m fine! Just hot coffee, ya know."

    "With a nervous chuckle, she puts her hands over her cheeks."

    may "Actually, yeah  Let’s go ahead and walk if you’re ready. It seems like a nice night to look at the stars."
