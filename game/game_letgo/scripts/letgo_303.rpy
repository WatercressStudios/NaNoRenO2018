    eli "Nah."

    eli "I’d come back as a zombie just to make sure you get that hot chocolate."

    eli "And more than that, you just up and poisoned yourself."

    may "{i}What.{/i}"

    eli "You said you’d try to poison me - but when I realized the hot chocolate was your plan, I thought up this counter-plan to have you drink it yourself!"

    may "Oooooh, back to that again. Okay."

    may "Clever."

    eli "...That’s it?"
 
    eli "C’mon, May. Normally you’d say that you’ve been taking small doses of the poison since you were a kid, and now you’re immune to it."
 
    eli "And then when I sipped the other drink, you’d say you bribed the coffee shop so they’d poison anything I bought from them."

    may "Heh..."

    "Hm. Not taking the bait, huh?"

    "I sigh."

    eli "Here. This one’s warmer."

    "I swap the drinks and she takes a sip."

    may "Mm. Yeah, that’s better."

    may "Excuse me?"

    eli "Yeah. Splurge a bit! Like a ski trip or something!"

    may "Ugh."

    eli "May?"

    may "Yeah. Sure. Ski trip. Fine. Because everything’s gonna be okay, and we’ll wrap it all up with a hunky-dory goddamn ski trip."

    "Um."

    eli "Well, we wouldn’t really \"wrap it up\" with the ski trip. There’d be a lot more dates to come after..."

    may "Oh! Of course! The other dates! The ones that we’ll have in our bright and happy future together."

    eli "I mean... I’d really hope so."

    may "Yeah, well sometimes, shit happens."

    "Did I do something wrong?"

    eli "Can we... try anyways?"
 
    may "...Huh?"
