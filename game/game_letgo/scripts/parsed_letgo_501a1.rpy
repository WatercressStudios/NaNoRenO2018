    "I quickly swipe the icy crystals away from my beanie. None of the bypassers seem to mind me talking to myself - or maybe they do just aren’t showing it."

    "Leaning against the tree, I tilt my head up upwards and glance over at the biggest clock in town."

    "Ack! Since when is she a pro-baseballer!? It’s like she’s been practicing this for days!"

    "Hearing a yelp behind me, I spin around and spot a random kid with snow all over his face. He glances down at the snowball in my hands and starts gathering his own."

    "Ignoring my protests, the kid lobs his, misses, and hits another bystander."

    "Oh no."

    "Pretty soon it’s The American Civil War, only it’s everyone against everyone. People are actually coming out of cafes and shops to join the fight!"

    #voice "C-501a1-12.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "Come on!"

    "Maya suddenly grabs my arm and pulls me behind the tree. It seems we’re now in an unofficial truce, using it for cover as we lob one snowball after another at strangers."

    eli "May, we’ve known each other for a long time, and… {i}watch out!{/i}"

    "I quickly pull her towards me, out of the path of a double-projective, resulting in two narrow misses. It looks like the battle’s intensifying!"

    #voice "C-501a1-20.mp3" #Maya (shiena)
    may "Umm..."

    "Her body heat draws my attention back to her. She’s leaning against my chest, looking up at me with her large brown eyes. There’s a hint of a blush on her cheeks."

    "She nods. We take each other’s hands and run out of the plaza."
