    "I rub my arms and shake the snow off my boots. It’s getting chilly around here…"

    "I’ve been waiting for a while now - enough time to do {i}three{/i} different runs of the confession."

    "I’m starting to feel so confident that I’m actually putting off the fourth one... for now, anyway."

    eli "Hey Tree, what do you think’s taking her so long? Do you think I should, you know, call or text her again?"

    "A cold breeze rustles its branches and a handful of snow falls on top of my head."

    eli "Hey! Quit it!"

    "I quickly swipe the icy crystals away from my beanie. None of the bypassers seem to mind me talking to myself - or maybe they do just aren’t showing it."

    eli "Naw, you’re right. I don’t wanna appear too needy. She probably didn’t see the time or something. She does that sometimes - let’s time slip through her fingers."

    eli "At least I have you for company..."

    "Leaning against the tree, I tilt my head up upwards and glance over at the biggest clock in town."

    "Twenty minutes. Maya’s twenty minutes late. She’s been late before, but…"

    eli "She’s probably not coming, huh?"

    "I hope she’s okay. I should send her another text, just in case."

    "Letting out a disappointed sigh, I slowly close my eyes."

    "I’ve always loved the sounds in this plaza: the people, the cafe, the clocktower, the rustling branches."

    "I feel the edge of my mouth curving upwards into a smile."

    eli "Hey, Tree, have I ever told you about the time I realized I was in love with her? We were right here, and--"

    # Splat SFX, like a snowball hitting your head

    eli "May!?"

    "There she is, wearing the biggest grin on her face. One of her arms is clearly in a post-throwing position, while the other is armed with more icy ammo."

    eli "What are you--"

    # Splat SFX

    "Another snowball makes contact - with my face this time. I can practically taste the ice in my mouth."

    eli "Oh, you’re so on! {i}Bring it!{/i}"

    "I start laughing while gathering my own ammunition."

    may "Nuh, too slow!"

    "She laughs as she expertly dodges my flying snowballs. If I thought that would be the end of it, I was wrong."

    "Maya turns around and rapidly launches a couple high-velocity snowballs at me, one after the other!"

    "Ack! Since when is she a pro-baseballer!? It’s like she’s been practicing this for days!"

    kid "Owww!"

    "Hearing a yelp behind me, I spin around and spot a random kid with snow all over his face. He glances down at the snowball in my hands and starts gathering his own."

    eli "Wait, stop, I swear that one wasn’t me--"

    "Ignoring my protests, the kid lobs his, misses, and hits another bystander."

    "Oh no."

    "Pretty soon it’s The American Civil War, only it’s everyone against everyone. People are actually coming out of cafes and shops to join the fight!"

    may "Come on!"

    "Maya suddenly grabs my arm and pulls me behind the tree. It seems we’re now in an unofficial truce, using it for cover as we lob one snowball after another at strangers."

    may "So, don’t you have something to tell me?"

    eli "Huh?"

    "I duck just in time to avoid an icy projectile. She’s looking at the plastic flowers I put down at the base of the tree earlier."

    eli "Oh yeah!"

    eli "Wait, right now? It’s basically the Battle of Yorktown out there!"

    "As if to accentuate my point, someone yells {i}\"on my mark, fire!\"{/i} and a great flurry of snowballs fly from one group to another."

    eli "Actually, you know what..."

    eli "Screw it, let’s do it!"

    "I turn to her bravely, and..."

    eli "May, we’ve known each other for a long time, and… {i}watch out!{/i}"

    "I quickly pull her towards me, out of the path of a double-projective, resulting in two narrow misses. It looks like the battle’s intensifying!"

    may "Umm..."

    "Her body heat draws my attention back to her. She’s leaning against my chest, looking up at me with her large brown eyes. There’s a hint of a blush on her cheeks."

    eli "Uh, uh, I’m sorry! I--"

    may "Oh, for crying out loud."

    "Maya suddenly tiptoes and kisses me on the lips. I feel my head clouding over and my own cheeks burning. Is this really happening?"

    "When we finally part, she leans over and picks up the plastic flowers."

    may "I like you too, Eli."

    # scene and sound changes so it’s just these two kids

    "The entire world falls away at that moment until it’s just the two of us left. We slowly smile at each other, and I feel a warmth rising in my chest."

    "Nothing can distract me now."

    eli "Shall we go?"

    "She nods. We take each other’s hands and run out of the plaza."
