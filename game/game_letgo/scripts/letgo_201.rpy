    "..."

    "The snow-heavy tree I’d confessed to was a very patient - if not very talkative - witness when I got tongue-tied. That must really come from what, hundreds of years of being alive?"

    "How long have we worked together, anyway? Sheesh, I’m still babbling at May like an idiot!"

    eli "Maybe I shouldn’t have waited until it was so cold, or maybe--"

    "She raises a hand; the fuzz of her glove makes my nose itch just a little."

    may "Eli. Eli, listen to me: It’s {i}perfect{/i}. It’s not all that cold. In fact, do you know why this time is perfect?"

    "{i}Perfect?{/i} This is a complete and utter {i}mess{/i} - but she looks so happy, how can I make her mad by arguing against that?"

    Eli "It’s a great time to make snow angels?"

    #maya laugh sound

    may "What? No! The Lampoon Street neighborhood is setting up already!!"

    "Oh yeah, the neighborhood where everyone goes nuts with holiday decorations!"

    "It’s after Thanksgiving after all - and of course, as long as snow’s on the ground, it’s not too early to string up some lights. I gotta say, I can’t exactly fault them for getting into the spirit of things…"

    "Besides, it’s {i}their{/i} bills that go up for the season, not mine."

    eli "That’s a great idea! There won’t be too many people this time of year."

    eli "Oh! I almost forgot."

    "I hold up the delicate-looking flowers and she scrunches her nose for a moment."

    eli "I didn’t forget the other part: plastic and silk; they’ll last forever and won’t give you allergies."

    #Maya sprite gets close to Elijah’s

    "She accepts them and hugs me tight, almost jumping onto me."

    eli "Wow, that’s better than I expected! Urk... and heavier!"

    may "Deal with it, because they’re wonderful! You always remember the important things when it matters."

    #maya sprite moves back

    "She wraps her arm around mine, shaking her boots free from the snow; it falls around her in tight, wet chunks."

    "I wish it was dry and fluffy... It would make crazy drivers less of a problem - even if it makes the world look prettier overall."

    "Not to mention: the snow really does favors for those stockings she’s wearing. Wow!"

    may "Well, shall we go on our romantic walk together? First night as boyfriend and girlfriend? You know, the things we used to make fun of on Singles Awareness Day?"

    eli "All the sap and more, of course! \"And next spring, on Oxee Channel, the tale of love that bloomed in winter!\""

    may "God, that would be so embarrassing - especially if it was on TV..."

    eli "Yeah, seeing their confession would probably take half the movie and a quarter of the sequel."

    may "Don’t be silly, it’ll be the whole movie for them! They like the melodrama, and you know it."

    eli "And the whole will-they, won’t-they... But we don’t have to worry about that now."

    "Nope, not at all. I finally built up the courage and said how I really felt."

    "What a waste of time to wait so long! Well, not a complete waste on reflection; being friends has led to some of the funnest and best times I’ve had. If anything, it just made my feelings stronger."

    #hide talksprites

    "Tonight, that’s what really matters: our feelings and time together - the place where we are now, even if I don’t know where we’re going yet."

    "But damn, I’m excited to find out."
