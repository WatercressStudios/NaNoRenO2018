    "We decide to walk to the part of town where the big decorations are - though we didn’t exactly hold hands."

    "Some of the sidewalks aren’t exactly as well-shoveled as they could be…"

    #show Maya, is there a way to have her sprite ‘slide’ around the screen?

    may "Whoa-woah!"

    "She yelled just a little - waving her arms as she slid around the sidewalk on a patch of ice."

    eli "This has gotta be either the folks that went down to Florida or just came from there, because wow. Haven’t they heard of salt?"

    "I help steady her, then walk as carefully as I can... Well, I thought I was, anyway."

    #Eli slides off screen right (if we can do that)

    eli "Crap crap shiiii--!"

    # sfx crunch/crash/snow crunch

    # eli laughing

    eli "Ow, ow ow! Wow, for a moment, it felt like October."

    may "You alright?"

    "May looked and sounded a little nervous there. I’m not a klutz... okay, not {i}often.{/i}"

    eli "Ow. Okay, well I feel like I’m at least in one piece."

    #eli at right
    #may at left

    may "Should we go check it out? We can do this another night if you want to turn back."

    eli "Haha, I’m fine, I just have a snowy butt."

    may "A {i}showy{/i} butt, too!"

    eli "Pfft, Maymay...."

    eli "We’ll head back once we get through this street and I’ll take some aspirin or something. Ready for some sights almost pretty as you?"

    may "Flattery really gets you everywhere, Eli."

    "The sky suddenly started to clear up; a few flakes fell, lazily floating down on the slightest of breezes. They dusted her hair and made a delicate crown of snow."

    "Maya really is beautiful. I’m lucky to have someone in my life like her. I think, even if she turned me down, I’d have been okay with staying friends." 

    "But she said yes! I’m surprised, of course - and the happiest I’ve been in a long time… every second together drags on, but in a good way."

    may "Finally, some shoveled {i}and{/i} salted sidewalks."

    eli "No kidding. Now I can do {i}this!{/i}"

    # eli sprite moves to may 

    "There’s something warm and precious about a first kiss; the flowers fall and the petals are dusted with now - but silk washes clean."

    "...Huh. I should write that down later. She picks up the flowers and carefully puts them in her pocket before we continue."

    #may at right, eli at left

    may "That was unexpected. And pretty nice."

    "I lead her forward, never glancing back."

    "Dammit, I’m doing that right now. Oh well."

    "I know she’s there behind me, and I can’t help but savour every second of it."
