    #eli at right
    eli "Woah. Some old couple has some goodies set out!"

    #may at left
    may "Holiday at the Ritz Tour, huh?"

    eli "Oh my god, I can smell cider and hot chocolate. Want to go warm up a bit? We’ve been walking for a while."

    may "Well, it’s pretty cold out. Won’t hurt any to stop for a bit and warm up."

    ow "Why hello! You’re lucky; we just got some fresh hot milk and water for the next tour! They'll be another fifteen minutes or so, but we like to be prepared."

    om "Oh, a young couple at that."

    eli "How can you tell?"

    om "Just by looking, you seem happy and excited. And where you look doesn’t hurt either, haha~!"

    ow "Oh, honey… don’t tease them too much!"

    may "Do you think they're nuts or anything? I mean, not a lot of people offer free stuff anymore."

    eli "I, for one, welcome the crazies with hot cocoa and cider."

    may "Ha, can't choose between them?"

    eli "My dear loves, chocolate and tart cider, shall simply take turns!"

    #May snort/laugh

    may "You don't say! Well, guess they'll have to wait until I look like that lady, then."

    "I had to laugh, though…"

    "Growing old together... I hadn't really thought about it too much before. I can almost see it - and I hope she’s still smiling just as much as she is tonight when she gets wrinkles and white hair."
 
    "That would be worth the world to me."

    ow "Still, young lady, would you like something to drink? It's actual cocoa in the white cups, but the ones with a black band are made from the sugar-free powder."

    may "Ooh, do you have marshmallows?"

    "The old lady led her away, and suddenly I’m alone again."

    "Or I would be, if not for the tap on my shoulder as I take a cider. The steam billows up, carrying the scent of apples and spices to my nose."

    "As I sip on it, I turn around."

    om "You look… relieved, young man - and tense!"

    eli "First dates are kind of a big deal, haha~! Anyone’s going to be a bit nervous."

    om "Oh my. And to think, when I first met my wife, there was a big hullabaloo! Well, son. You have good reason to be."

    eli "Isn't some confidence-building in order?"

    "I kind of laugh. After all, this isn’t exactly the sort of thing I expected upon setting out for a neighborhood’s yearly \"good natured\" competition to see who can raise their light bills the highest."

    "You know, they kind of remind me of us - but the old lady’s black and the man seems… I dunno, Scandinavian?" 

    om "A lot of couples don't make it. This is what it looks like to beat the odds! Hahaha!"

    eli "Oh. That's… nice?"

    om "So you’re a new couple, eh?"

    eli "Yeah, just today! We’ve been friends for a long time; we’ve worked together..." 

    eli "We don’t anymore though - and, well, it’s been tough seeing each other when it’s {i]not{/i} crazy. We’ve been through a lot."

    om "Sounds like you’ve got something a lot of young men never do."

    eli "And what’s that?"

    om "If you don’t make the time to be together, you’ll never find it. So many youngsters forget that they’ve got to make room for the special moments. We only ever have so many - and I can prove it at my ripe old age!"

    "You know, that made a lot of sense to me." 

    "I glance over at Maya, and she’s huddled with the old lady, talking up a storm - though I can’t really tell what they’re going on about. It’s kind of warbly. Maybe I have some wax in my ears?"

    "The house seems warm, bright. The windows that I can see through are full of knick-knacks and pictures."

    "For some reason, an old cloth kite was hung in one. It looked battered and like it had been sewn together in places, oiled with streamers still hanging, the tails looking as if they were still in flight."

    eli "What’s that over there? A fan of a certain old musical?"

    om "Oh! That was one of the first kites I made when I met my dear wife. It wasn’t the best I had, but I kept it." 

    m "And that one? That was the day I first knew I loved her. A plane can float along the breeze, free as it can be - but a kite, well. It needs a connection. We each fly because the string holds our sails taut. We help each other be free."

    "I hadn’t thought about our new relationship like that. Some of my friends often moan and groan about things tying them down, but May..."

    eli "Light as a feather. That’s how she makes me feel. I hope I can make her feel like that, too."

    "She and I each grabbed a fresh cup when she came back, giving a few parting words to the friendly old couple."

    "I grasped her hand, feeling just... blown away by how lucky I am to have her with me. It seems like she felt the same for me..."

    may "Can you imagine this, Eli?"

    eli "I can imagine us like this, if that’s what you’re talking about."

    may "That-- That would be..."

    "She actually chokes up and embraces me for a good minute or two."

    may "That would be all I could ever ask for and so much more, Eli - except, maybe you could accept pineapple as a pizza topping."

    eli "Never! That’s a dessert waiting to happen."

    "I hoped the day would never end - but the sun is painting the sky a beautiful burnt orange; lavender set in as the stars began peeking out. Then comes the moon."

    "We leave the old couple, walking hand in hand, now up the way from what I hope will someday be our own future."

    "The lights continue creating a halo around us on this calm, snowy night."
