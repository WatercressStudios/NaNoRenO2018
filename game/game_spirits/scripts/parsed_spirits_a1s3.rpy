    "I head over and sit down beside him; he smiles warmly at me."

    "I’m lucky someone’s being so nice to me on my first day. With everything that’s happened, I deserve a little good luck."

    alx "Thanks."

    "I reach forward and take a roll from the basket. It’s still warm, and steams when I cut it open. I then serve myself some rice and beef stew."

    "It’s good, which surprises me. Growing up on Indian food makes everything else seem flavorless, but Jianmei certainly knows how to use her spices."

    cae "So...you transferred two weeks into the school year?"

    "I look over at Caelum. It’s an honest question, and he’s clearly trying to make conversation…"

    "In short, I appreciate it."
