    hmom "Alex, have you seen Caelum around anywhere?"

    alx "…"

    alx "…He wasn’t in class this morning. I hoped {i}you{/i} knew why."

    "I can feel the cold weight of dread twisting in my chest. I suddenly have a very, {i}very{/i} bad feeling about this."

    hmom "I heard that from some of the other girls, too, but I didn’t have any idea. He {i}does{/i}  skip breakfast sometimes, so I just thought…"

    "Jianmei wrings her hands nervously and clearly bites down on the inside of her cheek."

    hmom "This isn’t like him."

    hmom "I’m… I’m going to go into his room. Maybe he’s just been sick?"

    "Looking like she’s just witnessed a plane crash, Jianmei turns around and drifts back into the hallway towards Caelum’s room."

    "I hop off the bed, urgently following behind her."

    #scene hallway

    "The closed door feels… ominous, in a way - like some kind of cyclopean monolith, tainted by echoes of ancient violence."

    "Oh god, oh god, oh god, what’s happened to him?"

    "Jianmei spends way too long running her eyes over every individual key she has, and I feel like I’m going to scream if she doesn’t just unlock the freaking door already."

    "Every little hesitation - the way she initially turns the key in the wrong direction, then turns it the right way but has to jiggle it - makes me want to just shove her out of the way and kick it down myself."

    "Finally, the door unlocks, and it slowly creaks open."

    "…"

    "There’s nothing in here. Nothing at all."

    "The bed is neatly made. There’s no signs at all that anything out of the ordinary has happened."

    hmom "Strange…"

    "She gingerly steps into the room, but I storm in past her."

    "As soon as I cross the threshold, it feels like I’ve shoved my left arm - my lost arm - in a tub of ice water."

    "Slowly, a dull, throbbing pain crawls up that missing limb."

    "The whole room is permeated by a kind of acrid, sickening miasma. It’s… it’s nauseating, like smelling something profoundly rotten; somehow, though, it transcends that in the \"physical\" sense."

    "I know - if only from Jianmei failing to remark otherwise - that to mundane senses, this room is entirely normal."

    "God, what the hell happened here?"

    hmom "That jacket he loves so much is still hanging there in the closet… and his phone’s there on the bed. Why would he leave all his things behind?"

    "Though I barely pay attention to her words, her observation helps something click for me. I don’t want to believe it, but I know it to be true."

    "…Caelum’s almost certainly dead."

    hmom "Oh, you poor child… I never thought you would depart in such a hurry."

    hmom "Couldn’t you have trusted me?"

    "What is she even talking about?"

    alx "Jianmei. We need to call the cops."

    hmom "I plan to."

    "As if to punctuate that sentiment, she digs her phone out of her pocket and begins sifting through the contacts."

    hmom "Honey, we’re going to do everything in our power to find him - but I have a feeling wherever he is, he doesn’t want to be found…"

    alx "What?" 

    hmom "Caelum… had a lot of problems with his family. And the faculty at Oxton hasn’t been especially kind to him, either."

    alx "Wait, you’re serious? You think this is about {i}his{/i} problems?"

    hmom "Well, of course! Maybe his bastard father abducted him."

    alx "Jianmei, I really don’t think you’re approaching this the right way--"

    "But she just cuts me off with a single raised finger and brings the phone up to her ear."

    hmom "Hello, yes, this is the house mother, Fang Jianmei, calling from Artemis Hall at Oxton Academy. One of my residents has gone missing. He’s a minor."

    "She turns her back on me and steps out of the room, apparently intent on finishing the conversation in her office. She’s all business - as if I’m not even here."

    "When she vanishes down the corridor, the biting, screaming sensation of a migraine hits me in full force - so overwhelmingly devastating it forces me to my knees."

    "I feel something in the vestige of my arm, like somebody’s throwing a handful of sand at me. It lands on my arm and sticks, as if defying gravity."

    alx "Eugh… what...?"

    "I feel t his strange sensation, like vertigo; am I lying down or standing up? And then the \"sand\" hits me again, splashing against my back and coming to rest upon it."

    "There’s this wet, metallic smell filling my nostrils. Blood? It’s oozing everywhere…"

    "I’m buffeted once again by-- no, it’s not sand. It’s {i}dirt{/i}, cool and loamy."

    "…I’m being buried alive. That’s what it is."

    "I move to brush the dirt - the invisible dirt, which doesn’t actually exist in Caelum’s room - away; when I touch myself I don’t feel my own warmth, only cool, dead flesh."

    "No, not buried alive."

    alx "::Screams::" 

    "For a moment, I snap back to reality; I’m standing here, warm and alive, in this abandoned room - and the terror is enough that I dash back across the hall."

    "Once there, the miasma fades away. The migraine subsides into a light buzzing. I’m alone once again."

    "But I’m tired… so tired."

    "Caelum’s dead. I know it."

    "The first friend I’ve made in as long as I can remember, and now he’s gone."

    #if HasDiary = False:
    "Maybe there’s no hope; maybe this is the world telling me I don’t get to be happy."

    alx "Why… why can’t I just live?"
    #else:
    "It’s the spirits inhabiting this house. They took my friend from me. They’ll take {i}everything{/i} if I let them."

    "I’m just saying my goodbyes to Naniji when I notice Caelum hovering in the doorway. I motion for him to come in and he does, leaning against the wall."

    cae "That was your grandma?"

    alx "Yep! I was just calling her to tell her how I was settling in."

    cae "You lived with her, right? Do you guys get along?"

    alx "Mm-hmm! I mean, as much as anybody can get along with their guardian."

    alx "She grew up in Delhi, though, so… she definitely has a different cultural outlook than I do."

    cae "Do you have any other friends or relatives that you call? I don’t really see you on the phone that often…"

    alx "Yeah, um… well…"

    alx "You see… I had friends before the accident - but afterwards, it wasn’t the same, and moving away didn’t really help."

    alx "I spent so long in the hospital, and then I was homeschooled afterwards, so… I mean, all the encounters with ghosts certainly haven’t helped my social life."

    "It feels so hard to admit…"

    "After a while, I stopped even trying. It just seemed like an uphill battle. I always had some new excuse to avoid others."

    cae "Yeah, well. I understand being lonely."

    "He purses his lips contemplatively, his eyes flitting off to some point in the distance."

    cae "I have a large family, I guess - but it’s never really felt like it. It’s just been me and my mom for the last couple years."

    alx "Huh? You’re an only child too?"

    cae "Nah, youngest, but my older sisters are \"Daddy’s Girls…\" We don’t talk."

    cae "All in all, my family hasn’t been too great about… you know."

    "He gestures to himself with a dramatic sweep for emphasis."

    alx "Right…"

    cae "It’s fine. Screw ‘em. Friends are the only family I’ll ever really need."

    cae "I know you don’t really know them yet and it’s kinda freaky, but the girls here are pretty cool when you get to know them."

    cae "Sammi’s a really talented artist, Ashton does archery on horseback, Lexa’s bizarrely obsessed with professional wrestling…"

    cae "You’d like them, I think."

    alx "Hmm…"

    "God, I’d almost forgotten, in the wake of all this crap with the ghost."

    "The whole reason I’d been so excited to attend this school in the first place was because I wanted to start living a normal life again; I wanted to make friends and be {i}functional.{/i}"

    "That’s what I want - what I need. Then I started getting harassed again, and closed myself off to everyone but Caelum…"

    "I can’t forget to live."

    #if HasDiary = True:

    "I’m staring dumbfoundedly at the diary when Caelum steps into the room."

    cae "Alex, you okay?"

    alx "Y-Yeah…"

    alx "Uh, why don’t you come in?"

    "Caelum blinks at me worriedly and takes a few tentative steps into my room, running his hand through his hair."

    cae "What is it you’re reading?"

    alx "The… The diary of a servant that used to work in this house; it’s pretty bad."

    alx "That girl - Genevieve - her father locked her in her room for weeks. And then one day, he just walked into her room - {i}this{/i} room - and butchered her."

    cae "Jesus {i}fuck{/i}. Are you serious?"

    alx "Yes… And she wasn’t the only one."

    alx "The servants all started disappearing after that… This diary just ends after a random entry."

    alx "I think… I think he killed them all."

    "I feel… I feel so overwhelmed. I’ve been to places with a miasma hanging over them before - but this is a house where a {i}massacre{/i} happened…"

    "God, what am I going to do?"

    "Frowning, Caelum steps over and takes a seat beside me." 

    cae "Alex."

    alx "Hmm?"

    cae "I don’t… Um, do you really feel like you have to do this? I mean, you have the diary; can’t you just give it to the authorities and let them figure things out from here?"

    "Tempting though that is, I shake my head."

    alx "This thing’s like a hundred years old. You think they’ll even care?"

    cae "So, what, it has to be you?"

    alx "I-I guess. Nobody else can do what I do, so…"

    cae "But what do you even {i}owe{/i} this ghost? It’s not like she’s treated you with any respect."

    alx "It… it isn’t about whether or not she’s {i}nice{/i}."

    alx "I’m never going to have a moment’s peace unless I can get these spirits to leave me alone."

    alx "And even if these people are long-dead, they still deserve justice."

    cae "So you have to put your entire life on hold until all the ghosts are happy?"

    alx "{i}Yes{/i}, Caelum."

    "I let out a sigh, sinking my arms backwards into the mattress."

    alx "Dammit, I’m so exhausted…"

    alx "You don’t get it. You don’t know what it’s like."

    alx "I often wonder if I’ll ever just have a chance to {i}rest{/i}. Ugh, probably not."

    cae "Alex…"

    alx "I really thought this school was going to be a clean slate for me, but it seems like there’s some new horde of ghosts jumping at the chance to take advantage of me around every corner…"

    alx "I hoped this school would be a sanctuary from it all - but maybe that doesn’t exist."

    cae "We’ll make it exist."

    alx "Will we?"

    cae "If the alternative is you seeing yourself as just some instrument at the spirit world’s disposal? Fuck yeah, we will."

    cae "But… you have to take that step, Alex. You shouldn’t have to feel like you’re always waiting to begin living. You deserve to do things for yourself."

    cae "Don’t hold yourself to their schedule. Justice can wait."

    "I almost want to tell him about the inspection, but I can’t bring myself to quite yet…"

    cae "After all, it’s not like they’re gonna die of old age."

    alx "Heh…"

    alx "We’ll see."
