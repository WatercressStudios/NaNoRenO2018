    "Ugh…It was so much easier to pack and lug these suitcases around when I had Naniji to help me…"
     
    "At least it’ll be nice to have the rest of my things again. I didn’t grab nearly enough clothing when I was reassigned to Sekhmet Tower; I’ve been wearing the same pair of socks for days!"
     
    "Dammit, the wheels on my suitcases keep snagging on each and every crack in the sidewalk… This is going to be such a pain."
     
    "I guess I could have made multiple trips, but the tower’s at the other end of the Oxton campus… It’s so exhausting."
     
    "Hopefully this is the last time I have to move into a new place for a while…"

    "I turn my head towards the voice and see Caelum coming up behind me, a massive duffle bag slung over his shoulder."

    cae "’Sup, Alex?"
     
    voice "C-16-4.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "You didn’t text me that you were picking up your stuff!"
     
    #show caelum smiling
     
    voice "C-16-5.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "I didn’t think you had picked up yours yet!"
     
    "I drop my luggage to wrap my arms around him in a hug, and he returns the gesture, grunting somewhat under the weight of his bag. His embrace is warm and strong."
     
    "Taking a few seconds to savor the moment, I finally pull back and give him a hopeful look."
     
    voice "C-16-6.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "Does the fact that you’re moving out mean they’ve finally assigned you a new dorm? {i}Please{/i} tell me it’s Sekhmet Tower. I don’t know {i}anyone{/i} there."
     
    voice "C-16-7.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "Uh… No, actually."
     
    "He looks a bit sheepish, pausing to readjust the shoulder strap on his chest before answering."

    cae "They made a spot for me in Gilgamesh."

    alx "What? Seriously? Ugh, that blows…"
     
    voice "C-16-10.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "…Wait."
     
    voice "C-16-11.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "I thought Gilgamesh was an all-boys dorm?"
     
    voice "C-16-12.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "Heh, yeah. I guess after we uncovered a crawl-space full of skeletons, the administration felt the least they could do was start treating me with some human decency." 

    voice "C-16-13.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "Honestly, I just don’t think they liked how it played with the media. I’ve been getting a lot of emails from attorneys…"
     
    voice "C-16-14.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "Well, at least {i}some{/i} good’s come from all of this."
     
    voice "C-16-15.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "I’m still honestly not sure how I feel about them demolishing Artemis Hall…"
     
    voice "C-16-16.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "Are you kidding me? Generations of girls were sleeping on piles of old murder victims. There’s, like, tons of people claiming to be traumatized now."
     
    voice "C-16-17.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "Kinda weird that I’m one of the ones who actually {i}found{/i} the bodies, and I’m pretty okay about the whole thing…"

    voice "C-16-18.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "Yes, but… I miss how it felt to live there."

    voice "C-16-19.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "I miss Jianmei’s cooking. I miss living across the hallway from you."

    voice "C-16-20.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "Do you miss being harassed by ghosts?"

    #show caelum concerned

    voice "C-16-21.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "Wait. You’re not going to be harassed by ghosts at Sekhmet Tower {i}too{/i}, are you?"

    voice "C-16-22.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "Haha, no. For all its faults, it was only built four years ago. Not really a robust breeding ground for the spirit world."

    voice "C-16-23.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "There’s a shade in Daphne Woods for whatever reason, but all she does when I walk by is tell me that I’m pretty - so whatever."

    #show caelum relieved

    voice "C-16-24.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "Thank god. After everything you’ve gone through over the past…" 

    voice "C-16-25.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "Has it really only been a few days? It feels like it’s been a month." 

    voice "C-16-26.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "I know, right? I feel like I’ve been here forever - like we’ve been having ghost adventures for a lifetime."

    voice "C-16-27.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "Ghost adventures… That sounds like one of those shitty ghost hunting TV shows." 

    voice "C-16-28.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "Don’t get me started on those. I have… way too many feelings about them." 

    voice "C-16-29.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "Yeah, I’d imagine." 

    #show caelum embarrassed

    voice "C-16-30.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "So, I was wondering… "

    voice "C-16-31.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "I mean, you’re probably busy - but if you’re not, there’s this really nice ice cream place just off campus, and if you wanted to, maybe we could go?" 

    voice "C-16-32.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "It’s really good, kind of expensive, but I’d treat you because, y’know, we found {i}bones underneath our dorm{/i}, and I think that deserves a little R&R." 

    voice "C-16-33.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "They make the ice cream in-house with, like.. organic milk, and I know that stuff is sorta bullshit but you can really taste it and--"

    voice "C-16-34.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "W-Wait."

    voice "C-16-35.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "Are you… I mean, you’re, like-- I mean, what you’re saying is…"

    voice "C-16-36.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "Hah, I mean, I was deliberately trying to {i}avoid{/i} going full middle school with it, but if you’d like me to spell it out--"

    voice "C-16-37.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "YesI’dloveto!"

    voice "C-16-38.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "Sweet. I mean, cause of the ice cream and cause of the--"

    voice "C-16-39.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "Date, yeah." 

    #show caelum happy

    voice "C-16-40.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "Good. Gives me something to look forward to, because my teachers haven’t been very understanding about this whole ordeal." 

    #show alex exasperated 

    voice "C-16-41.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "Oh I know, right? I have an essay due in a week, ten pages, with three empirical articles as sources." 

    voice "C-16-42.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "We just found dozens of {i}dead bodies{/i} on campus. In our dorm. That isn’t worth a few days off?" 

    voice "C-16-43.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "Apparently not." 

    voice "C-16-44.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "..." 

    voice "C-16-45.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "So, you better get--" 

    voice "C-16-46.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "Yeah, I really ought to get going." 

    voice "C-16-47.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "You don’t need help?" 

    "He’s the only person who could offer help without making me mad." 

    #show alex happy

    voice "C-16-48.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "No, I’m okay. Thank you, though." 

    voice "C-16-49.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "Alright. See you in class?" 

    voice "C-16-50.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "Yep." 

    "I don’t want to walk away. I’ve been through so many changes. Why am I so reluctant to face this one?" 

    voice "C-16-51.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "Text me if you need help with homework, okay?" 

    voice "C-16-52.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "Yeah." 

    voice "C-16-53.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "Hey, Alex. Look at me." 

    voice "C-16-54.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "Everything’s going to be fine." 

    "I believe him. I actually believe everything is going to be alright, and the shock of that hits me harder than I’d like to admit." 

    "When was the last time I thought things were going to be okay?"

    "I haven’t had this much hope since before my parents died." 

    "I look up into his bright eyes, and there is no pain in my hand or my head. I can’t help but smile." 

    voice "C-16-55.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "I know."
