    hmom "Don’t ask about the door; it’s been closed as long as I’ve been working here. I think it leads nowhere anyway, so… nothing to worry about!"

    "I crash onto the bare mattress as soon as I’m alone. That… was not very easy."

    "Never in my life could I have imagined a housemother would be the scariest thing at boarding school."

    "I always expected it’d be bullies, or homework, or haunted dorm rooms."

    "Naniji would find this hilarious, I’m sure."

    "She’d be laughing her head off and I’d never hear the end of it."

    "After a few minutes of doing nothing, I get up and start pulling things out of my bags."

    "I make the bed; hang up my clothes; and set my watercolours and used textbooks on the desk."

    "Come to think of it, Naniji and I bought these in quite a hurry… I haven’t even had time to look at them."

    "As I move closer to the tiny door from earlier, however, my prosthetic swings a little too enthusiastically and bangs against the lock."
