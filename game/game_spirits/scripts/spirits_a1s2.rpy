    "I’m probably being ridiculous..."

    "It’s an old building. I can’t be jumping at shadows just because I found some weird stuff in a room."

    "I’ll bet that old box wasn’t even used to store a gun, like I thought! Some of the little velvet compartments look like ones you’d keep jewelry in - or maybe a pack of cards."

    "Still, I’ll feel better if I bring it up to somebody."

    #scene hallway

    #show alex worried

    "I poke my head into the hallway, but Jianmei’s already long gone."

    "From the doughy aroma wafting up the staircase, it seems she’s working on dinner; I don’t know if I feel comfortable barging in and interrupting just to ask her about an old box and how gravity works."

    "Can I just wait to bring it up at dinner, or…?"

    caex "You need help finding anything?"

    #show alex startled

    "That tenor voice suddenly rings out, and I jump in surprise."

    #show caelum closed_smile

    "Across the hallway and just a few feet to the right, a boy is leaning casually in an open doorway."

    "He’s regarding me with an expression of laid-back curiosity."

    #show caelum concerned

    caex "Oh, sorry! I didn’t mean to startle you."

    alx "N-No, you’re fine! I’m just… a little jumpy, that’s all."

    #show caelum closed_smile

    caex "Gotcha. I’ll keep it in mind."

    alx "Um--"

    alx "Thanks."

    #show alex embarrassed

    "I can feel heat rising to my cheeks ,and I hate myself for it. First impressions are hard enough as is - so when they’re unexpected, they’re nearly impossible!"

    alx "Er..."

    alx "You… wouldn’t happen to know if whoever lived in the room before me had a service dog or anything, would you?"

    #show caelum thoughtful

    caex "A… service dog?"

    caex "Is something in there triggering your allergies?"

    alx "No, nothing like that! There’s just some weird claw marks on the wall behind my desk."

    #show caelum confused

    caex "Claw marks? Weird..."

    caex "I, uh, don’t think there’s been any animals in there recently, but I haven’t lived here all that long."

    caex "I think you can write a maintenance ticket, if they’re bothering you..."

    #show alex resigned

    alx "No, no, it’s fine! I was just curious."

    alx "There’s something else in my room, too: an empty box with a velvet lining?"

    caex "Like a jewelry box?"

    alx "No, it’s all varnished pine on the outside. It looks really old."

    caex "Uh…"

    "He shrugs at me with a crooked little smile."

    #show caelum closed_smile

    caex "Congratulations on your new box, I guess?"

    #show alex confused

    alx "Eh?"

    caex "I mean, it’s a pretty old house; there’s probably all sorts of weird junk in the nooks and crannies."

    caex "When I first moved into this room, I found a tall stack of old-timey photos on the top shelf of my closet."

    #show caelum serious

    caex "...All of them were of livestock. Every. Single. One."

    alx "Seriously?"

    caex "Yep. What they were doing in a boarding school dormitory is beyond me."

    cae "Jianmei didn’t much care what I did with them, so I just pitched ‘em."

    cae "...Except for one, which I added to my personal collection."

    #show alex wtf

    alx "..."

    #show caelum smirking

    caex "I’m kidding."

    #show alex blush_smile

    alx "Oh, hahaha!"

    "God, it feels like I haven’t laughed in years."

    "For that matter, it feels like I haven’t even spoken to a boy my age since I was discharged from the children’s hospital… It’s kind of strange to think about."

    alx "... "

    #show alex puzzled

    alx "Um. Hmm."

    cae "Something wrong?"

    #show alex flustered

    alx "Not at all! It’s just… campus housing told me that Artemis Hall was a girls’ dorm."

    "As soon as the words leave my mouth, the boy’s posture visibly stiffens; his eyes drift somewhere up and behind my head."

    "He runs a hand through his combed hair and sighs."

    #show caelum resigned_smile

    caex "It is."

    alx "Really?"

    caex "Uh, yeah…"

    caex "...I’m trans. A trans guy."

    #show alex surprised

    alx "...Oh."

    #show caelum tired

    caex "I’ve been on testosterone for a while... The administration said the school would be accomodating."

    caex "But when I got my housing assignment, they stuck me here; told me their hands were tied because my birth certificate is wrong or something."

    #show alex sad

    alx "That’s… I’m--"

    "But he waves away any sympathy with an emphatic slicing motion."

    #show caelum resigned_smile

    caex "It’s fine! It is what it is."

    caex "Honestly, this is the nicest house on campus, so… whatever."

    caex "And people here are pretty alright."

    alx "Well, I’m glad for that, at least."

    "He seems like it doesn’t bother him, but I still feel kind of offended on his behalf…"

    "...And I’m kind of bummed out that even a relative paradise like Oxton has its wrinkles."

    "Wait! Oh my god... where are my manners?"

    alx "Um, sorry, I’m all over the place today! I never even introduced myself…"

    alx " I’m Alex Kartha. I guess we’re going to be neighbors, huh?"

    "Without thinking, I wave my left arm in greeting. His gaze catches on the bulky prosthesis, but he quickly recovers and meets my eyes again."

    #show caelum closed_smile

    caex "I guess so. And, no problem. I’m Caelum Bentley. \"He\" pronouns are fine. "

    #show alex happy

    alx "Oh, um. \"She\" pronouns for me."

    cae "Cool."

    cae "And, uh, I like your… arm?"

    #show alex sweat_smile

    alx "Oh, heh, thanks."

    alx "It was 3D-printed. I picked out the color scheme myself."

    cae "Whoa, nice. I didn’t even know you could do that."

    alx "Yeah…"

    "Usually, I’d leave it at that - but a part of me feels like there’s a kind of \"imbalance\" between us; he shouldn’t have had to admit that..."

    "Maybe I can even us out by sharing a little and satisfying his curiosity."

    #show alex sad_smile

    alx "Uh, it was a car accident. When I was ten. Uh, if you’re wondering."

    #show caelum aside_glance

    cae "I… was, but I wasn’t going to say it."

    "Usually, I’d expect someone to offer their condolences or something; Caelum simply nods - perhaps having internally realized the words would be trite platitudes."

    #show alex happy

    alx "It’s fine."

    alx "It’s funny, actually; I only ever think about my arm when other people ask about it."

    alx "And it got me a scholarship here, so I guess it’s worked out for me somehow."

    cae "Guess so. I have a feeling you’ll like Oxton."

    alx "Here’s hoping!"

    #show alex surprised

    alx "Oh... I’d better get back to unpacking my stuff…"

    cae "Sure, don’t let me keep you. It was nice talking, though."

    alx "It really was!"

    #scene alex’s bedroom

    "I think he’ll be a good housemate, even if he’s {i}really{/i} supposed to be in the male dorms."

    "It’s strange, but there’s something about him that puts me at ease; I guess it’s because we’re both outsiders, in a way?"

    "Hopefully we can be friends..."

    "I continue unpacking. I have way too many clothes; I really ought to give some away." 

    "The time quickly passes, and soon it’s six o’clock. I head downstairs for dinner."
