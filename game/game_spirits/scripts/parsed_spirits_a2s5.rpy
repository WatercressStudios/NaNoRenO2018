    "I wake up earlier than usual - but why?"

    "My alarm clock hasn’t gone off yet, and I almost want to fade back into sleep…"

    "But then I hear someone grunting in the hallway, and there are objects thudding against the floor. Maybe it’s for the best."

    "It’s not like I have much of a choice anyway.."

    "During my morning ritual, I realize something:"

    "I’m behind on all of my assignments. The teachers are lenient about it, but the guilt is just building up."

    "Actually, I think I woke up because of this vague dream I had…"

    "In it, I sat in class, opened up a folder, and started sifting through the papers for a specific assignment."

    "Almost every single one was covered in red marks."

    "It’s a sign that my academic duties are being neglected… It’s all because of these ghosts just wrecking my life."

    "I look outside my room, but it’s just Jianmei moving boxes from the attic."

    "I would like to help, but I have a lot on my plate right now."

    "So I sit at my desk and decide to do a worksheet."

    "It’s an easy assignment, so I speed through it."

    "Wow… there’s a lot - and I’ve only been here a few days!"

    "I work and work, until Jianmei’s intense racket permeates all of my senses."

    "I don’t understand how or why she’s doing it by herself."

    "I guess it doesn’t hurt to give myself a break; I have plenty of time."

    "Then I realize… I have to do laundry, too! God, I hate doing laundry."

    "I guess I have no choice but to leave my room."

    "I open my door and peek outside; the hallway is a mess right now."

    "Jianmei hears me come out and looks over, sweat dripping down her forehead. She must be getting one hell of a workout"

    alx "Would you like some help? You’re struggling a lot."

    "Maybe if I do, I’ll get some peace and quiet."

    "Besides, no one should have to deal with that much work. It’s inhumane."

    hmom "Oh yes! Please, please!"

    "Jianmei pulls out a cloth and dabs her forehead. I climb up the ladder and see the attic for the first time."

    "Thankfully, there isn't anything out of the ordinary. I'm dealing with enough oddities these days that a few boxes are a welcome sight."

    "Well, \"a few\" is an understatement - and each is filled with god knows what."

    "There's a broken lamp and a dilapidated rocking chair in the corner. The light's dim, which makes it hard to see things unless they’re right in front of you."

    "It smells heavily of dust and mildew. Jianmei climbs up and directs me to a few boxes that she deems takeable."

    "I two small boxes up and tuck them under my arms like suitcases - but then, from the corner of my eye, I see something slip out from underneath one."

    "I look down; it's a piece of paper. My hands are kind of full, though, and I don’t want to waste Jianmei’s time. She's already exhausted."

    "Something keeps urging me to look at it. Ugh, do I really have to?"

            your previous correspondence.{/i}"

    alx "Ha, I’ll try."

    "Eventually, we clean out the attic - and by the time we’re done, I’m itching all over from the dust and filth."

    "Also my back hurts. But I’m young, I will live, and I still have a whole day ahead of me."
