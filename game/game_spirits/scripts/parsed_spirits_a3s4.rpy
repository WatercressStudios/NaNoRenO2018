    "I flick the lights on and immediately wither under their radiance."

    "I stagger over to the bed - and into another repetition of this vicious cycle."

    "At first there’s the cold - so much more intense and biting than any I’ve experienced. My skin tingles, and then {i}writhes.{/i}"

    "After that, there’s an emptiness in my stomach; I must be hungry - but I don’t have it in me to eat unless other people are watching."

    "It spreads outward until I am completely, utterly hollow."

    "At last, the overall malaise pulses outwards in a sort of body-wide phantom pain."

    "Is this what it feels like when your soul leaves you?"

    "I collapse against the mattress and lay there for several long seconds, smothered by a pillow."

    "Realistically, I want to sleep - but if these past few days have taught me anything, it’s only going to make waking up even more difficult than usual."

    "That is if I don’t dream about recent events…"

    "With a sigh, I force myself to roll over onto my back."

    "I stare at the ceiling for several long seconds and take nothing in."

    "The only sound - the only sensation - is my breathing; that only compounds just how {i}empty{/i} the room feels."

    "Maybe if I’d have gone with Caelum, I’d--"

    "No… I couldn’t burden anyone like that."

    "I’ve already done it enough."

    "At last, I force myself to roll over onto my side."

    "Maybe if I just close my eyes and clear my--"

    "{i}Head?{/i} Yeah, right. Everything {i}feels{/i} clear - but each thought is fragmented or interrupted by another."

    "It’s kind of like the opposite of a silent scream: there should be clarity, but instead there’s noise."

    "Finally, I force myself to sit up."

    "Or rather, I try to - but my body is held to the bed by gravity."

    "Keeping with today’s \"theme\" of contrast, I feel floaty when I finally manage to sit up."

    "There must be something I can do, right?"

    "There’s nothing - until suddenly, a kernel of thought makes its way to the forefront of my mind."

    "Suddenly, my mind is abuzz… and then it all goes quiet."

    "If I could silence the spirits, then I can silence everything."

    "It would be so easy to do…"

    "As easy as pointing and pulling a trigger."

    "On autopilot, I reach over towards a sheet of paper and a pen."

    "{i}The last thing I want is to be dependent on other people.{/i}"

    "{i}If you can’t live for yourself, is that really living at all?{/i}"

    "{i}I can’t even look at myself in the mirror anymore. I don’t recognize the person there.{/i}"

    "{i}And anyone who looks at me probably sees that reflection - but the truth is? She’s stronger than I am.{/i}"

    "{i}I can’t…{/i}"

    "I can’t do this."

    "It doesn’t feel right."

    "{i}But I have to.{/i}"

    "Something deep down tells me that’s the case."

    "Sighing, I cross out the lines and start again."

    "By the time I’m finished, the paper is a nearly-illegible mess."

    "{i}No.{/i}"

    "No matter how much I try to read it, the words won’t register; the only thing that comes to mind is that single thought."

    "But why? No to what?"

    "I take the note in my trembling hands and hold it up to the light for a second as if trying to search for some kind of hidden meaning."

    "Suddenly, I think I’ve found one."

    "And the second that realization hits me, I ball the paper up and violently pitch it into the trash."

    "But then, fatigue sets in."

    "I don’t need words to communicate how I feel. That’s not the point here."

    "Using whatever energy I have left, I fumble around looking for something."

    "And then, I feel its cool metal exterior against my hand."

    "I twist it, turn it, and examine it for several long seconds."

    "Should I really be doing this?"

    "{i}I have to.{/i}"

    if hasAmmo == False:
        "Last night, I discovered that old pine box hadn't been so empty, after all."

        "Like serendipity, I found a single, lone bullet tucked away under the loose velvet lining of the interior compartment."

        "Who else would that be meant for, if not me?"

    else:
        "A single shot was all it took to free {i}them{/i}, so why not me?"

    "With several deep breaths, I slowly bring the gun to my head."

    "I close my eyes and wait."

    "How long will it take me to find the nerve?"

    "The only thing I can hear is my heartbeat."

    "It grows louder, until at last, it consumes me; the world fades away."

    "And then suddenly, it’s all back."

    "I exhale, and feel my arm tremble."

    "Just point, click, and then--"

    "{i}Nothing.{/i}"

    "No. Not like this."

    "This isn’t right."

    "Nothing feels right."

    "Someone will come running, and I can’t subject them to this."

    "And I know that if I don’t choose something immediate, I won’t go through with this."

    "Why? Why is this so hard!?"

    "Just like before, there’s a sudden and violent burst of energy."

    "Before it can register, I’ve tossed the gun onto the bed and started walking away."

    "The medicinal smell and pristine walls envelop my senses."

    "And looking into the waiting room only makes my stomach churn. Is there anyone there like me?"

    "I can’t do this!"

    "But someone’s probably noticed me, and walking out would look bizarre…"

    "Who am I kidding, anyway? It doesn’t matter if I {i}want{/i} to; I {i}have{/i} to."

    "When I finally approach the receptionist, they aren’t even looking at me."

    "Well, I guess that’s one thing to be happy about."

    "When she finally does, my mouth goes dry."

    "Why!?"

    "What is {i}wrong{/i} with me!? This should be so easy!"

    "And then, she shatters the silence."

    nurse "How can I help you today?"
