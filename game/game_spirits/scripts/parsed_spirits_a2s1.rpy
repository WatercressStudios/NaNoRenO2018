    "When Caelum leaves, I realize I’m still nervous; it all returns in an instant - from the knot in my stomach to the lump in my throat."

    "What the spirit told me yesterday keeps echoing in my head; I even dreamed of searching for the \"last step.\""

    "Of course, as soon I wake up, I don’t remember what it looks like or the process of finding it."

    "Then again, the dream could have been wrong."

    "Usually, I believe that dreams are prophetic - typically warnings - but I don’t think an answer will come so easily this time."

    "I guess I’ll have to search for it with every ounce of my energy. "

    "I try doing some breathing exercises while I go through my morning routine."

    "After all, the amount of stuff I’ve been dealing with lately should send me to the hospital with some kind of heart trouble."

    "I pace back and forth to burn off nervous energy, because something is telling me I’m just waiting for another surprise."

    "I think I just really need to calm down. A lot." 

    "I breathe in one more time and twist my doorknob..."

    voice "C-9-1.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "OH MY GOD, ALEX."

    "Caelum rushes into my room and doesn’t even give me a chance to speak. He almost knocks me over - and just as I’m about to yell at him; I notice his expression…"

    voice "C-9-2.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "When I left your room last night, I was walking in the hallway. There’s was no one around."

    voice "C-9-3.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "But I felt this cold breeze and there were chills going down my spine."

    voice "C-9-4.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "I saw it:  a monster, a huge smoke cloud."

    voice "C-9-5.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "It was coming after me. It knows me, and it wants me under its grip."

    voice "C-9-6.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "I held out my crucifix, since I didn’t know what else to do, and when I turned around, it was {i}charging{/i} toward me--"

    voice "C-9-7.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "And it was holding up something…. sharp? Almost like a spade, I think?"

    voice "C-9-8.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "And I didn't even think. I just hurled my crucifix at it and ran."

    "Caelum is wearing a mixture of confusion and fear; he’s second-guessing everything he has just seen - but I believe him. After what I’ve experienced, I almost have to."

    voice "C-9-9.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "N - no biggie, I mean, that crucifix was just a gift from my dad anyway, so I was going to pawn it off first chance I got…"

    "I lead him to my bed, give him pillows, and an animal plush… but nothing’s working."

    voice "C-9-10.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "Alex, I don’t completely know what you’re going through and I don’t think anyone else will believe it - but I want you to know that I do."

    voice "C-9-11.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "I don’t know what’s going to happen after this."

    voice "C-9-12.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cae "Can I just stay here for awhile?"

    "I want to say that he shouldn’t be here, but I let him stay anyway."

    "Silence hangs between us for several long moments; we sort of bask in each other’s presence, despite the tension."

    "When he finally leaves, I watch him walk down the hall. He looks back at me as if fearing it’ll be the last time we ever see one another…"

    "But somehow, I don’t think so."

    "And in the end, I’m wide awake at three in the morning."

    "Shit."

    "How did Caelum even get in here, anywhere?"

    "Actually, I probably just left my door unlocked. Naniji always used to call me out on it…"

    "...And Mom, and Dad too."

    voice "C-9-13.mp3" #Papa (N/A)

    Dad "{i}Ooooooooh!{/i}"

    "...Fuck."

    "I don’t want to think about that."

    "If I go any further down that rabbit hole, I’m going to start screaming again; then Caelum will come running back again, and we’ll just repeat the same events."

    "This has to be another dream."

    "All of it."

    "The ghosts, the school, Caelum, my parents…"

    "I just wish I could forget about all of this for once."

    "Or wake up - that would be nice."

    "I’ll go insane if I don’t."

    "Sometimes, I can’t even tell what’s real and what’s in my head."

    "I’m doubting everything I know, because I can’t have confidence in anything."

    "Even the laws of physics hate me; what if it’s just a poltergeist, instead of gravity?"

    "Very funny, Alex."

    "Is going my parents’ way better than whatever {i}this{/i} is?"

    "No. I don’t want that at all."

    "I’d be giving up on myself if I chose that path."

    "Everything up to this point would have been for nothing. I’m not going to let that happen - that much is true."

    "Whether it’s for Naniji’s sake, Mom’s, Dad’s, Caelum’s, or some ghost’s…"

    "Even for my own..."

    "I’m not going to let this break me."

    "I’m not going to let this chance go to waste."

    "I’ll have to promise myself that, if anything."

    "...But for now, I should sleep."

    "If I can’t, I’ll just… relax until morning."

    "I can figure out what to do then."
