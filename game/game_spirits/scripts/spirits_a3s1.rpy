    "Ugh…It was so much easier to pack and lug these suitcases around when I had Naniji to help me…"
     
    "At least it’ll be nice to have the rest of my things again. I didn’t grab nearly enough clothing when I was reassigned to Sekhmet Tower; I’ve been wearing the same pair of socks for days!"
     
    "Dammit, the wheels on my suitcases keep snagging on each and every crack in the sidewalk… This is going to be such a pain."
     
    "I guess I could have made multiple trips, but the tower’s at the other end of the Oxton campus… It’s so exhausting."
     
    "Hopefully this is the last time I have to move into a new place for a while…"
     
    cae "Hey, you need a hand?"
     
    "I turn my head towards the voice and see Caelum coming up behind me, a massive duffle bag slung over his shoulder."
     
    #show alex happy
     
    alx "Caelum!"
     
    cae "’Sup, Alex?"
     
    alx "You didn’t text me that you were picking up your stuff!"
     
    #show caelum smiling
     
    cae "I didn’t think you had picked up yours yet!"
     
    "I drop my luggage to wrap my arms around him in a hug, and he returns the gesture, grunting somewhat under the weight of his bag. His embrace is warm and strong."
     
    "Taking a few seconds to savor the moment, I finally pull back and give him a hopeful look."
     
    alx "Does the fact that you’re moving out mean they’ve finally assigned you a new dorm? {i}Please{/i} tell me it’s Sekhmet Tower. I don’t know {i}anyone{/i} there."
     
    cae "Uh… No, actually."
     
    "He looks a bit sheepish, pausing to readjust the shoulder strap on his chest before answering."
     
    cae "They made a spot for me in Gilgamesh."
     
    alx "What? Seriously? Ugh, that blows…"
     
    alx "…Wait."
     
    alx "I thought Gilgamesh was an all-boys dorm?"
     
    cae "Heh, yeah. I guess after we uncovered a crawl-space full of skeletons, the administration felt the least they could do was start treating me with some human decency." 

    cae "Honestly, I just don’t think they liked how it played with the media. I’ve been getting a lot of emails from attorneys…"
     
    alx "Well, at least {i}some{/i} good’s come from all of this."
     
    alx "I’m still honestly not sure how I feel about them demolishing Artemis Hall…"
     
    cae "Are you kidding me? Generations of girls were sleeping on piles of old murder victims. There’s, like, tons of people claiming to be traumatized now."
     
    cae "Kinda weird that I’m one of the ones who actually {i}found{/i} the bodies, and I’m pretty okay about the whole thing…"

    alx "Yes, but… I miss how it felt to live there."

    alx "I miss Jianmei’s cooking. I miss living across the hallway from you."

    cae "Do you miss being harassed by ghosts?"

    #show caelum concerned

    cae "Wait. You’re not going to be harassed by ghosts at Sekhmet Tower {i}too{/i}, are you?"

    alx "Haha, no. For all its faults, it was only built four years ago. Not really a robust breeding ground for the spirit world."

    alx "There’s a shade in Daphne Woods for whatever reason, but all she does when I walk by is tell me that I’m pretty - so whatever."

    #show caelum relieved

    cae "Thank god. After everything you’ve gone through over the past…" 

    cae "Has it really only been a few days? It feels like it’s been a month." 

    alx "I know, right? I feel like I’ve been here forever - like we’ve been having ghost adventures for a lifetime."

    cae "Ghost adventures… That sounds like one of those shitty ghost hunting TV shows." 

    alx "Don’t get me started on those. I have… way too many feelings about them." 

    cae "Yeah, I’d imagine." 

    #show caelum embarrassed

    cae "So, I was wondering… "

    cae "I mean, you’re probably busy - but if you’re not, there’s this really nice ice cream place just off campus, and if you wanted to, maybe we could go?" 

    cae "It’s really good, kind of expensive, but I’d treat you because, y’know, we found {i}bones underneath our dorm{/i}, and I think that deserves a little R&R." 

    cae "They make the ice cream in-house with, like.. organic milk, and I know that stuff is sorta bullshit but you can really taste it and--" 

    #show alex blushing

    alx "W-Wait."

    alx "Are you… I mean, you’re, like-- I mean, what you’re saying is…"

    cae "Hah, I mean, I was deliberately trying to {i}avoid{/i} going full middle school with it, but if you’d like me to spell it out--"

    alx "YesI’dloveto!"

    cae "Sweet. I mean, cause of the ice cream and cause of the--"

    alx "Date, yeah." 

    #show caelum happy

    cae "Good. Gives me something to look forward to, because my teachers haven’t been very understanding about this whole ordeal." 

    #show alex exasperated 

    alx "Oh I know, right? I have an essay due in a week, ten pages, with three empirical articles as sources." 

    cae "We just found dozens of {i}dead bodies{/i} on campus. In our dorm. That isn’t worth a few days off?" 

    alx "Apparently not." 

    alx "..." 

    cae "So, you better get--" 

    alx "Yeah, I really ought to get going." 

    cae "You don’t need help?" 

    "He’s the only person who could offer help without making me mad." 

    #show alex happy

    alx "No, I’m okay. Thank you, though." 

    cae "Alright. See you in class?" 

    alx "Yep." 

    "I don’t want to walk away. I’ve been through so many changes. Why am I so reluctant to face this one?" 

    cae "Text me if you need help with homework, okay?" 

    alx "Yeah." 

    cae "Hey, Alex. Look at me." 

    cae "Everything’s going to be fine." 

    "I believe him. I actually believe everything is going to be alright, and the shock of that hits me harder than I’d like to admit." 

    "When was the last time I thought things were going to be okay?"

    "I haven’t had this much hope since before my parents died." 

    "I look up into his bright eyes, and there is no pain in my hand or my head. I can’t help but smile." 

    alx "I know."
