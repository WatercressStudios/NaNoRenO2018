    "Ughhh…"

    "Where-- Where am I?"

    "I don’t know what happened…"

    "My body… Oh god, my body..."

    "Wait, it feels normal enough. I can wiggle my toes."

    "But ugh, my leg hurts… Does that mean…?"

    #scene alex_bedroom_vwhatever

    "I open my eyes. I’m in my room. Lying on my bed."

    "How did I get here?"

    cxx "Welcome back to the land of the living."

    cxx "Or, at least, the world of the embodied."

    "I strain to push my upper body from the mattress to look. Caelum’s sitting in my chair, watching me with a smirk."

    "Except… something’s wrong. His body language - the way he’s looking at me…"

    #show caelum smug

    alx "…Caelum? What… what’s happened--"

    gez "…Not my name, Alex."

    "No."

    "{i}No.{/i}"

    alx "Genevieve?!"

    #show caelum thoughtful

    gez "Not sure I’ll keep using that name, either. Doesn’t really seem to fit anymore."

    #show caelum angry

    gez "And the man who gave it to me was an ass."

    "How dare she…!"

    #show alex pained

    "Outraged, I try to stand up, but my leg howls with pain when I put pressure on it."

    #show caelum smug

    gez "You’ll probably want to see a doctor about that. It hurt like hell. Though, I don’t think you broke anything other than pride."

    gez "Well, on the other hand, maybe you’re just shaky from re-entering your body. Your soul {i}was{/i} ripped out for a while, after all."

    gez "I know it can be a little disorienting at first."

    #show alex pained

    alx "You bitch… What have you done to us? Why are you possessing Caelum?"

    "She laughs at me as I stagger towards her, and it’s horrifying. Caelum’s face should {i}never{/i} laugh that way."

    gez "I’m not {i}possessing{/i} anyone. I’m inhabiting {i}my{i} body."

    #show alex angry

    alx "That isn’t your body."

    gez "Heh. You haven’t figured it out, have you?"

    gez "I took over your body and threw you out, remember?"

    gez "It was practically effortless. Pretty easy to drag your soul away, with part of it hanging out like that."

    gez "You should be grateful. The only reason you’re not a phantom, trapped forever in this hell with {i}that man{/i} like I was, is because your boyfriend caught me with one foot out the door and refused to let me go."

    gez "Of course, there was nothing he could do to {i}force{/i} me out, so he made me a better offer."

    #show alex horrified

    alx "N-No…"

    #show alex horrified

    alx "No, please! If you’re going to take anyone, it should be me!"

    gez "Pass. Already gave it a whirl. I like this one better."

    gez "This body… isn’t what I expected, to say the least - but it’s complete, and it has its charms. Yours, on the other hand - no pun intended - has a pretty obvious security flaw."

    alx "You can’t… let him go, {i}please{/i}! Give him back his body!"

    gez "Oh, honey, I’m not imprisoning your friend. He’s gone."

    alx "Then let him back in, please!"

    #show caelum solemn

    "Genevieve’s stolen face frowns at me, as if I’m the biggest idiot in the world."

    gez "You don’t get it. You don’t {i}want{/i} to get it."

    gez "Caelum sacrificed himself to save you. He left his body knowing he’d succeeded. What about any of that sounds to you like unfinished business tying his spirit to this world?"

    alx "No…"

    gez "I’m sorry. He crossed over. No coming back from {i}that.{/i}"

    "NO!!!"

    "My veins fill with fire; I lunge towards her - but she effortlessly catches my arm in midair with one of her stolen hands, holding my other shoulder back with the other."

    "I thrash wildly against her grip, but she’s too strong and I’m too weak. She’s holding me back like I’m a rag doll."

    alx "You bitch! You killed him! You {i}killed him!{/i}"

    "I bow my head forward to headbutt her, or rip her throat out with my teeth - but I don’t get anywhere near her."

    alx "{i}You! Killed! Him!{/i}"

    "Impulsively, I move to knee her in the stomach - but I barely brush against her, and my balance is off. All the movement serves to do is send me crashing to the floor."

    gez "Stop this."

    "Her tone seems… restrained, now - almost subdued, as if I’m the most pathetic creature she’s ever seen."

    "Maybe I am."

    gez "For Caelum’s sake, I don’t want to hurt you anymore."

    "I stir again, trying to push myself up off my wobbly legs. She just shakes her head and places her hands under my arms, lifting me to my feet herself."

    "But it isn’t a kindness. She briskly hoists me like I’m nothing but a child, and carries me to my closet."

    alx "What are you--"

    #hide alex

    "She unceremoniously drops me there, where I crash relatively painlessly into boxes and clothes. Before I even have a chance to get my bearings, she shuts the door in my face."

    alx "Wait, no!"

    "But it’s no use. I can hear my padlock sliding into place and clicking shut."

    "I desperately slam my body against the doors - but they’re solidly built."

    #show caelum bored

    gez "Just mellow out in there for a while. Maybe use this time to contemplate how agonizing it is to be trapped somewhere, dependent on the kindness of others to be free."

    alx "…Fuck you."

    #show caelum angry

    gez "You only have yourself to blame for this. All I wanted was to cross over, but you ignored me."

    gez "But, well, there’s more than one way to take care of unfinished business. If I’ll never have justice, a new life will do just fine."

    #show caelum smug

    gez "What’s so wrong with that? I thought you said you {i}liked{/i} reincarnation."

    alx "And when your time finally comes? You really think you’re going to wind up with your mother after this?"

    #show caelum scowl

    gez "Pfft. As if you’re in any position to cast judgment, pagan."

    "As if to punctuate that sentiment, Genevieve curtly turns her back on me, casually walking to the door as if I’m just a buzzing voice in her ear."

    alx "Wait! Where are you going?!"

    gez "Anywhere but here. I’ve spent enough time in this prison of a house.."

    alx "No! You can’t!"

    "She sighs, turning around. I know she can still see my eyes through the darkened slits in the door."

    gez "For what it’s worth, I’m sorry our paths had to cross. I spent enough time in your body to have a notion your life hasn’t been good."

    gez "I’ll pray for peace, for both of us."

    gez "But I also pray I never see you again."

    gez "Farewell."

    alx "No! Genevieve! Genevieve!"

    "She steps out of the room, and my bedroom door slams shut."

    "It feels… final. It feels like defeat."

    "Feels like my only friend is dead, and it’s all my fault."

    "In the darkness, there’s nothing but time - time to sit here, licking my wounds and pondering the gravity of my sins."

    "I tried to take that treacherous step. I tried to take control of my life - and in the end, all I did was make everything worse."

    "Can I even live with myself, knowing all that I’ve done?"

    "Can I even {i}call{/i} this living?"
