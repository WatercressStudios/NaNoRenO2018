    "I don’t know what happened…"

    voice "C-17-2.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)
    cxx "Or, at least, the world of the embodied."

    "I strain to push my upper body from the mattress to look. Caelum’s sitting in my chair, watching me with a smirk."

    "Except… something’s wrong. His body language - the way he’s looking at me…"

    voice "C-17-9.mp3" #Genevieve (Lasli Tran and Other)
    gez "Well, on the other hand, maybe you’re just shaky from re-entering your body. Your soul {i}was{/i} ripped out for a while, after all."

    voice "C-17-16.mp3" #Genevieve (Lasli Tran and Other)

    gez "You should be grateful. The only reason you’re not a phantom, trapped forever in this hell with {i}that man{/i} like I was, is because your boyfriend caught me with one foot out the door and refused to let me go."

    "NO!!!"

    "My veins fill with fire; I lunge towards her - but she effortlessly catches my arm in midair with one of her stolen hands, holding my other shoulder back with the other."

    "I thrash wildly against her grip, but she’s too strong and I’m too weak. She’s holding me back like I’m a rag doll."

    voice "C-17-30.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "You bitch! You killed him! You {i}killed him!{/i}"

    voice "C-17-31.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "{i}You! Killed! Him!{/i}"

    "Impulsively, I move to knee her in the stomach - but I barely brush against her, and my balance is off. All the movement serves to do is send me crashing to the floor."

    voice "C-17-32.mp3" #Genevieve (Lasli Tran and Other)
    gez "Stop this."

    "Her tone seems… restrained, now - almost subdued, as if I’m the most pathetic creature she’s ever seen."

    "Maybe I am."

    voice "C-17-33.mp3" #Genevieve (Lasli Tran and Other)
    gez "For Caelum’s sake, I don’t want to hurt you anymore."

    "I stir again, trying to push myself up off my wobbly legs. She just shakes her head and places her hands under my arms, lifting me to my feet herself."

    "But it isn’t a kindness. She briskly hoists me like I’m nothing but a child, and carries me to my closet."

    voice "C-17-34.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "What are you--"

    #hide alex

    "She unceremoniously drops me there, where I crash relatively painlessly into boxes and clothes. Before I even have a chance to get my bearings, she shuts the door in my face."

    voice "C-17-35.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "Wait, no!"

    "But it’s no use. I can hear my padlock sliding into place and clicking shut."

    "I desperately slam my body against the doors - but they’re solidly built."

    voice "C-17-36.mp3" #Genevieve (Lasli Tran and Other)
    gez "Just mellow out in there for a while. Maybe use this time to contemplate how agonizing it is to be trapped somewhere, dependent on the kindness of others to be free."

    voice "C-17-39.mp3" #Genevieve (Lasli Tran and Other)
    gez "But, well, there’s more than one way to take care of unfinished business. If I’ll never have justice, a new life will do just fine."

    voice "C-17-40.mp3" #Genevieve (Lasli Tran and Other)

    voice "C-17-41.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)

    #show caelum scowl

    voice "C-17-42.mp3" #Genevieve (Lasli Tran and Other)
    gez "Pfft. As if you’re in any position to cast judgment, pagan."

    "As if to punctuate that sentiment, Genevieve curtly turns her back on me, casually walking to the door as if I’m just a buzzing voice in her ear."

    voice "C-17-43.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "Wait! Where are you going?!"

    voice "C-17-44.mp3" #Genevieve (Lasli Tran and Other)
    gez "Anywhere but here. I’ve spent enough time in this prison of a house.."

    voice "C-17-45.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "No! You can’t!"

    "She sighs, turning around. I know she can still see my eyes through the darkened slits in the door."

    voice "C-17-46.mp3" #Genevieve (Lasli Tran and Other)
    gez "For what it’s worth, I’m sorry our paths had to cross. I spent enough time in your body to have a notion your life hasn’t been good."

    voice "C-17-47.mp3" #Genevieve (Lasli Tran and Other)
    gez "I’ll pray for peace, for both of us."

    voice "C-17-48.mp3" #Genevieve (Lasli Tran and Other)

    voice "C-17-49.mp3" #Genevieve (Lasli Tran and Other)

    voice "C-17-50.mp3" #Alex (Bonnie Mitchel)
    alx "No! Genevieve! Genevieve!"

    "She steps out of the room, and my bedroom door slams shut."

    "It feels… final. It feels like defeat."

    "Feels like my only friend is dead, and it’s all my fault."

    "In the darkness, there’s nothing but time - time to sit here, licking my wounds and pondering the gravity of my sins."

    "I tried to take that treacherous step. I tried to take control of my life - and in the end, all I did was make everything worse."

    "Can I even live with myself, knowing all that I’ve done?"

    "Can I even {i}call{/i} this living?"
