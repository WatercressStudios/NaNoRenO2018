    "Leaves of red and orange fall from the trees; sunlight shines through the canopy created by various branches."

    "Only then, I realize that I must have witnessed this scene a million times too many."

    "It’s almost funny, really: I’ve been here more times than I can count, but I still find myself shaking in fear."

    "Given it’s the closest thing to a goodbye in my life… I wish I could be at peace here - just once."

    "I brush the leaves out of my hair and off my skirt as an excuse to shake the nervous energy away."

    "It’s the first time I’ve been here in my new uniform: a red shirt and red tie, with a grey checkered skirt - and the mark of a school I hadn’t heard of until earlier this week."

    alx "Hey. Mom, Dad... How are you doing?"

    "I kneel down next to a large, two-person gravestone. My parents’ names are inscribed on it in a mother tongue I can barely recognize."

    "I set down a fresh white flower next to a wilted one from the day before… and the day before that, and the day before that too."

    "And then there was Dad’s birthday, and the day before that - when things were simply too hard to bear."

    "And the day before that, too… I was screaming and crying like a little girl who didn’t know how to say goodbye."

    "Maybe I still don’t."

    "...It’s been five years, Alex; what the hell are you doing with your life?"

    "I stretch my arm out in front of me and look down to my prosthetic hand."

    "If I have to live with this, I’d have liked to feel their hands in mine one last time."

    "I wanted to see them again - even if it’s only in my memories or dreams."

    "I just… had to."

    "Every day and every night, I think about how things could be different."

    "But nothing changes."

    "I can barely remember their faces."

    "I don’t know whether I should cry or be thankful."

    "Should I be glad that they weren’t there, or not?"
