    #scene cg [Caelum waking up Alex]

    alx "...Caelum?"

    cae "It’s me. I’m here."

    "My throat feels hot, dry, and raw."

    "I was… screaming in my sleep?"

    cae "...You okay?"

    "Through the moisture clouding my eyes, the walls look hazed and distorted."

    "The shadows seem to crawl, as though traces of my nightmare still linger in the room’s very atmosphere."

    "My whole body feels weak and slick with sweat. All my joints rumble with that fighting-off-a-virus kind of ache."

    "It’s a shame, then, that ibuprofen hasn’t worked in years."

    "I can’t speak at first; I stare out into the void, trembling a little. I can’t even comprehend it… what just happened?"

    "Caelum’s looking at me with an expression of patient concern - the same look I’ve seen so many times on Naniji."

    "Finally, he shatters the silence."

    cae "Uh, here, this might help."

    "He passes a cylindrical object to me - and I take with a hesitant hand."

    "It’s only a water bottle…"

    cae "You were, uh, screaming so much that I just kinda figured I should grab you some…"

    "He’s not wrong. I twist the cap off and briskly knock back half the bottle."

    "It’s not a miracle cure, but it sure is soothing."

    alx "Thank you so much. Really."

    "Caelum simply gives a patient nod in response."

    "Ugh, I’ve been crying…"

    "Grateful as I am that he came to help me, why does he have to see me like this?"

    "Why couldn't I have the dignity of hiding this side of myself from him for just one more day?"

    "I finally make a friend for the first time in ages, and within {i}hours{/i} he has to shake me out of a nightmare?"

    "…Why am I like this?"

    cae "Do you… I mean, I’ll listen, if you wanna talk about it."

    alx "It’s-- It’s nothing."

    "If this episode hasn’t been enough to make Caelum steer clear of me, telling him that I’m {i}constantly being harassed by ghosts{/i} will probably be the final nail in that coffin."

    "I won’t risk it, but I also feel guilty keeping so much from him - even if it’s early on."

    "Maybe if I…"

    alx "I… have a lot of issues stemming from the accident - more than just chronic pain."

    alx "A psychiatrist told me I have PTSD… I don’t know if I agree - but I have certain triggers, and there’s flashbacks."

    alx "I’m just kind of messed up in general, I guess."

    "Caelum listens intently, then nods. Like before, he knows better than to give condolences or advice."

    cae "…Well, I’m always around, if it helps to have company."

    cae "Uh, though, technically, we’re not supposed to be hanging out in each other’s rooms after-hours."

    cae  "But Jianmei is cool with it if you just want to, like, sip tea in the common area?"

    alx "That might be nice…"

    "Caelum’s body language is slightly more at ease now that I’ve \"opened up\" to him a little."

    "Is it right, though, to use my mental health issues as a smokescreen to hide the truth?"

    "Somebody was {i}murdered{/i} in this house - and I don’t know how recent it is. What if we’re all in danger?"

    "Is it even possible to warn him without seeming more than a little crazy?"

    alx "These kinds of episodes… are actually pretty uncommon."

    alx "I think I’m just, like, agitated about sleeping in a new place, you know?"

    cae "Yeah, I can get that. I mean, it’s pretty easy to get homesick if you’re not used to the whole boarding school experience."

    cae "Uh, if you ever want to get therapy, the counselors here are pretty chill? Way better than the administration, I promise."

    alx "Oh, I’ve got an appointment scheduled, actually. With a Marilyn."

    cae "Cool."

    cae "Uh, so are you okay?"

    alx "Fine. Really."

    cae "Okay. Well, remember, I’m here."

    cae "See you in the morning, then?"

    alx "Yeah! Good night, Caelum."

    cae "Night."

    "He steps out of the room, closes the door behind him… and immediately, there’s a profound sense of guilt weighing down on me."

    "There’s nothing I hate more in this world than lying - well, maybe ghosts… but lying is up there!"

    "I can’t risk damaging my reputation; if it got around that I believe in ghosts - that I’m constantly haunted - I’ll be spending the rest of my career as a pariah."

    "I just hope I did the right thing."

    alx "Caelum, wait… There’s really something I should tell you."

    "God, I’m really going to do it. I’m actually going to suicide bomb my social life and tell him. I must be {i}really{/i} losing my grip."

    "But if we’re all in danger…"

    cae "Hmm?"

    alx "Okay, look, I realize that this is going to sound completely nuts."

    alx "I don’t… think that I’m crazy, and I swear on the memory of my parents that I’m not messing with you, okay? I just need to tell you this."

    "Caelum quirks an eyebrow at me, but nods dutifully."

    cae "Sure. I’ll listen."

    alx "When I lost my arm in the accident… something happened - something I’ve never been able to completely understand."

    alx "You’ve heard of phantom pain, right?"

    cae "Yeah. It’s supposed to be pretty common, isn’t it?"

    alx "Yeah, but… mine is more literal, I guess."

    alx "I have some kind of… {i}vestige?{/i} I’m not even sure what to call it."

    alx "It’s like... Okay, imagine having one arm perpetually stuck through a hole in the wall, leading to another room. You can’t take your arm out of it, but you can move the hole around by walking - even if the other side of that wall doesn’t change."

    "Caelum furrows his brow at me, but remains silent."

    alx "And there’s… {i}things,{/i} on the other side - things trying to mess with you. Well, they’re really trying to mess with everything, but they’ll settle for you."

    cae "I’m… not sure I understand."

    alx "I’ll put it this way, then."

    alx "The first time I discovered I had this… burden, was when I was still at a children’s hospital in Minneapolis. My mother came to me and held my hand."

    alx "I {i}felt{/i} her. Felt her warmth; I could hear her voice reassuring me - telling me she had to go."

    alx "At that moment, her body was on life support, clinically brain dead, in a hospital in Saint Paul. Literally the opposite side of the Twin Cities."

    alx "That was the first and only time it’s ever been good; I honestly don’t know if that moment was worth it."

    cae "Ghosts? You’re describing ghosts, right?"

    alx "I am. At least, that’s how they describe themselves."

    "I can tell from the pensive way Caelum narrows his eyes that I’m losing him. Conflict is plainly visible on his face."

    alx "I know it sounds crazy! But--"

    cae "Are there ghosts in this house?"

    alx "…"

    alx "…Yes. There’s at least one - a very nasty and demanding one."

    #if 'urname' in SpiritsReadFlags:
    alx "Her name is Genevieve Bourlon, and she’s been messing with me ever since I came here."

    #else:
    alx "I don’t know her name, but she’s been messing with me ever since I came here."

    alx "And she was murdered here. In this room. The person responsible may even still be around, and a danger to all of us."

    alx "She begged me to help her get justice, but… I don’t even know if that’s possible anymore."

    cae "What can I do to help?"

    alx "I--"

    alx "Wait, are you saying that you believe me?"

    cae "I… think so, yeah."

    cae "I mean, believe me, I did {i}not{/i} grow up in a household where belief in ghosts was scorned - at least, so long as they were part of a trinity."

    cae "And there’s definitely some seriously weird, unexplained stuff in this dorm. We all pretend there isn’t, but I know something’s up--"

    alx "Oh thank god."

    "I can feel the tears streaming freely down my cheeks. Before I have a chance to think better of it, I’ve lunged forward to wrap him in a hug."

    cae "Oof! Alex!"

    alx "Thank you. Thankyouthankyouthankyou!"

    alx "Nobody’s ever believed me before…"

    cae "Hey. It’s alright."

    cae "Maybe tomorrow we can figure out who this ghost is, and how to get her to leave you alone?"

    alx "...Yes. Maybe."
