    "The box, the gun inside, the ghost - everything that has happened in the past twenty-four hours - is all I can think of as I trudge through the school’s long corridors."

    "I keep my eyes peeled and watch the other students as they pass me by; the last thing I want is to accidentally bump into someone."

    "After all, it’s only my second day; having to frantically apologize to someone is the {i}worst{/i} way to make a first impression."

    "So I keep moving forward, away from the clusters of people littering the halls."

    "Before I know it, I’m there."

    "I can’t remember, but that doesn’t really matter. So long as I can actually {i}stabilize{/i} my life - normalize it, even - I can deal with whatever schedules the school puts me on."

    "Hopefully, that’ll help with everything else, too."

    "Regardless, I step inside."

    "I look around the room - and yep, that’s a classroom alright."

    "The most I can say about it that it seems cleaner, or maybe more professional, in a way. I’m probably just imagining things, though."

    "I look to my right, and scrawled on the whiteboard is the phrase: Basic--"

    "...Beekeeping?"

    "{i}Right,{/i} this is the class that Caelum was talking about, isn’t it?"

    "I thought it was pretty interesting at first, but I guess it depends on how it’s taught…"

    "Whatever; that doesn’t really matter. As weird as it is, it hardly measures up to some of the things I have to see every day.."

    "I take a chair - completely unsure if it belongs to anyone or not - and plop down. I get my bag and takes my textbooks out…"

    "Then, the waiting game begins. I watch the door, waiting for the teacher’s grand entrance."

    "...How long is this going to take? I know I was pretty early, but still - as I see the others come in, I can’t help but think that--"

    "It’s a bag of… fairly large cookies. The chips are M&Ms - and they look good. Tasty, even!"

    "I look upwards to find out who is giving them to me, and…"

    "There's silence between us for a few seconds."

    "As eccentric as he can be - as much as I {i}still{/i} don’t get the joke - he… has been pretty nice to me. He’s really the only person I’ve talked to since coming to Oxton."

    "Another voice - louder than the cacophony around me - booms from the front of the classroom. The teacher, Mrs… still something I can’t remember, announces her presence."

    "I look to Caelum;  he's paying more attention to the teacher now."

    "I suppose this means we’ll figure things out later, then."

    "I turn and keep my attention rapt. Time to learn about beekeeping!"

    "The day passes by surprisingly fast; the teachers are kind and accommodating, the classes are interesting, and everyone seems nice enough."

    "After another delicious dinner, I clean my room - finishing just in time to get some homework done."

    "Despite everything that happened last night, I think I can be happy here."

    "Overall, though, I’m eager to get to bed."
