    "The freezing water runs through my hair and over my body, drenching me, cooling my core as it has the last hundred times."

    "I've gotten used to cold showers like this. It's just the way I have to live now."

    "Rinsing my body with my bar of soap, wringing out my hair, I get ready for another long night."

    "Hot water costs money. Water itself is too expensive already..."

    "My day job is boring - only worthwhile for the sake of some pocket change."

    "Stepping out of the shower, my feet hit the cold linoleum floor. I efficiently dry myself off and dress for the weather outside."

    "With my coat, gloves, and scarf on, I'm prepared for the hike it'll take to get to the right location."

    "It's a ways away, but not far enough to warrant driving. Gas, too, is expensive."

    "So is car insurance."

    "It's been nearly two years since I dropped out. My education was only holding me back in the end, anyway."

    "It took up so much of my time - of my life - that I couldn't focus enough time on what the spirits required of me."

    "They need rest, and I'm the only one that can give it to them."

    "At first, everyone I knew told me off for dropping out of high school. They called me a quitter, begged me to rethink my decision."

    "Some even thought I was crazy."

    "This is the only way I can cope with the pain. They don't understand that this was not my decision to make."

    "But regardless, I must make do."

    "I keep going forward. The path ahead of me is predetermined; where I get my money from, or my purpose, doesn't matter."

    "This time, it's a child."

    "I'm not sure what happened to him - but I need to do it, for his sake."

    "The walk is long and tiring. A dull throbbing begins in my legs, crawling up my arms and into my head."

    "I pull out a bottle, and down a couple pills."

    "The pain has been coming and going a lot more frequently as of late, and sometimes it’s enough to make me want to crack my head open and relieve the pressure."

    "I keep moving. I have no other choice."

    "At the very least, I have the luxury of medication right now - but I might not have that in the future, so I need to learn how to live like this."

    "Living with constant pain isn't something that I should fight against. Hell, a lot of people feel a similar pain - although not quite like mine."

    "Chronic pain isn't my burden alone - and even with my outlying situation, I can't give in. I won't give up, even if I have to keep going until my heart gives out."

    "The house creeps up on me, and I have to backtrack to get to it. Gazing upon it, my adrenaline spikes and a smile creeps upon my face."

    "I've learned to embrace this life. Everything else - the dead end job, the apartment, the walks - they are nothing more than preparation for the real event."

    "What I truly live for."

    "Everything else is a dull pain - a sort of background noise made from the rest of the world. None of that matters to me; there is only the hunt."

    "It's a hunger that cries out to be sated."

    "It’s what I’m here; it’s what they make me do."

    "The pain in my body intensifies as I enter the building. The cold showers have helped reinforce my resolve - my will to keep going is bolstered by this constant chill in the air."

    "It reminds me of my goal."

    "And so, with a grimace, I begin."
