    "Through the moisture clouding my eyes, the walls look hazed and distorted."

    "The shadows seem to crawl, as though traces of my nightmare still linger in the room’s very atmosphere."

    voice "C-8-24.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)

    voice "C-8-25.mp3" #Caelum (Daniel Acosta)

    "I finally make a friend for the first time in ages, and within {i}hours{/i} he has to shake me out of a nightmare?"
