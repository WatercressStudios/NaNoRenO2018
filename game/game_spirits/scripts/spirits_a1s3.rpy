    "Wow, this place is really fancy! I know tuition’s ridiculous, but how the hell did they afford all this?" 

    "Everything looks so fragile… Would they charge me if I broke something?" 

    "There’s only seven other kids living here? Well, including Caelum. Oh thank god, he saved a seat for me!" 

    "I head over and sit down beside him; he smiles warmly at me." 

    "I’m lucky someone’s being so nice to me on my first day. With everything that’s happened, I deserve a little good luck."

    "...Hopefully it’ll continue; the last thing I need is another {i}incident.{/i}" 

    #show caelum 

    cae "Quick tip: the rolls are to die for." 

    #show alx happy 

    alx "Thanks." 

    "I reach forward and take a roll from the basket. It’s still warm, and steams when I cut it open. I then serve myself some rice and beef stew." 

    "It’s good, which surprises me. Growing up on Indian food makes everything else seem flavorless, but Jianmei certainly knows how to use her spices." 

    cae "So...you transferred two weeks into the school year?" 

    "I look over at Caelum. It’s an honest question, and he’s clearly trying to make conversation…" 

    "In short, I appreciate it." 

    alx "Yeah, I didn’t find out about my scholarship until a week ago - and otherwise, I couldn’t really afford this place. So..." 

    #show caelum snarky/sly

    cae "Oh yeah, this place is ridiculous - but it’s better than home. For me, anyways." 

    #show Alex neutral

    alx "You don’t get along with your parents?" 

    cae "Mom’s okay, I guess; she let me come here. Haven’t talked to my dad in years, and I couldn’t be happier." 

    cae "What about you?" 

    #show Alex tense/bitter

    alx "We were close, but I..."

    "I’m sick of this conversation already."

    "I know he doesn’t mean any harm by it, but sometimes I just want to wear a shirt that says \"my parents are dead\" so I don’t have to tell everyone I meet."

    alx "I lost more than my arm in the accident."

    #show Caelum neutral/sad/awkward

    cae "Ah… sorry about that." 

    alx "All’s good. I live with my Naniji now; that’s Hindi for--" 

    cae "Grandmother, I know."

    #show Alex happy/surprised 

    cae "I uh… had a really good English teacher in middle school, and we read this book..." 

    alx "That’s awesome."

    #show Caelum happy/warm/kind

    cae "Well, anyway, if you need help catching up, I know we’ve got at least one class together: some Living-Learning thing. Hope you like honeybees." 

    "That actually sounds pretty cool." 

    alx "Of course I do! Is there a hive on campus?" 

    #show Caelum excited 

    cae "Yeah, actually! Some students started last year and now we’ve got a pollinator garden and a hive. They’re selling honey right now to fund the club, if you want some." 

    "When I applied, I just wanted to get away from {i}them{/i} - but this place is actually pretty awesome so far."

    "...Please, please, don’t let anything ruin this! I just want to be a regular high school student." 

    "There’s no way there’s any of {i}them{/i} here, right?" 

    #show Alex nervous/shy/neutral 

    alx "Yeah, that’s so cool! I could send some home to my Naniji; I bet she’d love that." 

    cae "You’re too nice. I’ve bought three jars and I’m hoarding all of them for tea."

    "No. Please, not here!" 

    cae "What was that?" 

    hmom "Oh, I’m sure it was just the pipes or something. This old house makes so many noises." 

    #show Alex confused/tense 

    alx "The pipes?"

    "No one at the table seems convinced by the answer - but they don’t seem bothered enough to question it either." 

    hmom "Maybe the heater, or something else. Don’t worry, Alex, dear; it’s really nothing to worry about." 

    "Looking down at my food, I suddenly feel nauseous." 

    "That’s {i}definitely{/i} something to worry about…"

    alx "I think I feel a migraine coming on. I should go to my room and lie down." 

    #show House Mother endearing/concerned 

    hmom "Oh really? Of course, but... do you need anything? Ice water?" 

    alx "No, I’m okay. I just need to go." 

    #show Caelum neutral

    cae "Feel better, okay?" 

    "I’ve known Caelum for less than a day - but for some reason, lying to him makes my stomach feel worse than it already does." 

    alx "Yeah, I-I will. Thanks."
