    "I can see my room."

    #bg room

    "In front of me. Around me. As if nothing had happened. As if--"

    "Of course nothing happened. I was just doing homework, why would--"

    "Why would {i}anything{/i} happen?"

    "I'm lying down, I think. I can see the room around me, but I can’t really feel my body. It’s like vertigo, like a bad dream…"

    "My proprioception is gone. Which way is up? I don’t know. I can't {i}see{/i} anything else other than the room around me."

    "I move to get up--"

    "The mattress doesn’t warp under the weight of my hand. It’s as though the quilted fabric’s as hard as a rock."

    "Like I have no mass whatsoever - more of an idea than a person."

    "What happened?"

    "Why is my body like this?"

    "I don't know."

    "I don't know, I can't remember, and no matter what I do - or how hard I try - I can't move."

    "Why? I want to scream, want to move, want to figure out what’s going on, want to--"

    "Footsteps. The sound of an unsteady gait, as if someone is limping into the room."

    "A shape appears on the fringes of my vision. It stands. Looks down at me with an… expression of sorts."

    "It's… me? I think? I look so pained..."

    "But it’s a me with two arms - my normal one, and one that shimmers in my vision, as if it were made of light."

    "I’m dazzled by it, even drawn to it. I reach out to touch the mirror - but to my confusion, there’s just a hand."

    "I clasp it - but I only feel vivid, radiant warmth."

    "My face seems alarmed at the contact, though, as though she wasn’t expecting it."

    gex "Oh, there you are."

    gex "God, that’s disorienting."

    "She meets my eyes now, and I’m so, so confused; is this a mirror or not? What's happening?"

    "Why is this--"

    gex "Thank you."

    "What?"

    "Why-- {i}how{/i} am I speaking?"

    gex "Oh… You’re not angry?"

    gex "Ah, I see what’s going on. Unfortunate."

    gex "Alexandra, look down at yourself."

    "As I-- as {i}it{/i} says that, I can feel a bitter realization crashing down on me. I’d never even stopped to consider my body, but..."

    "I look down at my hands. Two hands. I have {i}two{/i} hands… silvery hands. Transparent."

    "No."

    "{i}No.{/i}"

    "Am I…?"

    "I can't--"

    "I look at mys-- at {i}her{/i}, whatever she is. I try to open my mouth, but nothing comes out."

    "It doesn’t matter; there’s nothing to say."

    "I can't remember."

    "I don't get this at all."

    gex "So you're figuring it out."

    alx "I'm not, I can't--"

    gex "...?"

    "She - {i}it{/i} - looks at me, confused. There's nothing I can respond with. No way to…"

    "..."

    gex "You don't remember?"

    alx "No, I don't, I…"

    "Why aren't the memories coming back to me?"

    "Why don't I know what happened?"

    "I try to focus - but there’s nothing."

    "If it was there at all, it must have faded away..."

    "I look to the other me, hoping it'll give me an answer."

    gex "So this is what the decay looks like on the outside…? This is what happened to me?"

    alx "Decay?"

    "Silence - cold, uncomfortable silence - fills the room in the following seconds. Alex - the other me, the Not-Me - makes full eye contact."

    gex "Suppose I'll have to fill in the blanks for you. Maybe it’ll ease the pain, to understand."

    gex "This was your body. Now it's mine."

    "I feel as if a pit in my stomach should have opened up, but my body doesn't even feel numb. I don't feel the crawling dread I should be, either."

    "My body - or what's left of it - only feels nothing."

    gex "Now that you're like I was, you're starting to fade."

    gex "Before long, you’ll become like me. Like I was."

    "Like her?"

    "Like… who?"

    "Who is she? Who is the person in my body?"

    "I…"

    "I can't remember."

    gex "Your memories will go first. Your… {i}self{/i} will go next. You will erode. Your ego is dying."

    "Become... just like her?"

    "Like who?"

    "Become what?"

    "I don't know."

    alx "You did this…?"

    gex "I did."

    "I feel as if my body should be freezing up. I feel as if there should be something crawling up my arms, or my stomach."

    "I don't."

    alx "Why?"

    "I - the {i}thing{/i}, the Not-Me - stands there, unresponsive."

    "I guess I'm going to have to force an answer out of her, then."

    "I grip her shimmering hand; it’s solid in a way nothing else is. I bury my nails deep inside the warm flesh and angry black tendrils suddenly dance across the luminous skin."

    gex "Unngh…! Augh! Damn this body!"

    "Though it’s so hard to feel anything, I relish in the sight of her anguished expression. It feels… cathartic somehow, though I can’t even imagine why.."

    "But then her grimace twists into a mordant smirk."

    gex "I’m a fool for not anticipating that."

    gex "Well, enjoy your little victory while there’s still some to go around, I guess."

    "She laughs - though it’s a hollow, bitter sound."

    "Even though I can't feel the anger at first - even though I could barely even tell it was there - it eventually comes through."

    alx "…Fuck you."

    "She looks at me, with a… stern? Furious? I don’t know what it is, but there’s a {i}look{/i} in her eye. She sneers at me as she speaks, my own face making strange, unfamiliar expressions."

    gex "You only have yourself to blame for this, you know. All I wanted was to cross over, but you ignored me."

    gex "But, well, there’s more than one way to take care of unfinished business. If I’ll never have justice, a new life will do just fine."

    "She shrugs, the expression on her face becoming more smug."

    gex "What’s so wrong with that?"

    alx "So what, you're just going to run away with my body? Act as if there's no problem with that?"

    gex "Yes, I will. Just watch me."

    "As if to punctuate that sentiment, Genevieve snatches her spectral hand back and curtly turns away, stomping laboriously to the door."

    "Strange. I wonder how she hurt her leg like that?"

    "In an effort to stop her, I attempt to grab her hand again - but she swivels with unexpected haste and jabs me right in the solar plexus."

    "Absurdly, I’m knocked backwards, falling toward the floor, while she continues lurching on out of the room."

    "How…?"

    alx "Wait! Where are you going?!"

    gex "Anywhere but here. I’ve spent enough time in this prison of a house.."

    alx "No! You can’t! You can’t!"

    "She sighs, turning around."

    gex "For what it’s worth, I’m sorry our paths had to cross. I’ve spent enough time in this body to have a better understanding of who you are - who you were."

    gex "I don’t forgive you for ignoring me, but I think I understand why you did. And now… now I can’t ever forget."

    "She looks genuinely remorseful as she says those words with my stolen voice, and I see her bring her hand to her temple. Finally, she sighs."

    gex "Someday, I’m going to see this house burned to the ground. If you’re still here, maybe that will free you."

    gex "But if your soul should linger even then… I’ll pray for peace, for both of us."

    gex "Goodbye, Alexandra. And good luck."

    "She steps out of the room, and the door slams shut."

    "This can’t… this can’t be forever, can it?"

    "How did it come to this?"

    "I've lost everything - more than I ever even imagined I had."

    "Coming to this house… I had such hope of moving on. And now… now I never will!"

    "In the emptiness, this house - my eternal prison - there's nothing but time. Time to regret my actions. Time to spend awaiting my decay."

    "Time to spend awaiting the point where I turn into… something like {i}her.{/i}"

    "I tried to take that treacherous step. I tried to take control of my life, but all I succeeded in doing was ending it."

    "What could I ever have done to deserve this?"
