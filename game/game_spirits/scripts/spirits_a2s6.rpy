    "Homework’s the worst…"

    "Actually, it’s kind of novel to be doing it; I never got any back home, since I was homeschooled."

    "The days here are so much longer than I’m used to. It’s a little wearying."

    "It’s pretty easy to get overwhelmed, too… This four-page assignment is due tomorrow, and I haven’t even started it."

    "At least Artemis Hall has a pretty swanky study room…"

    "Taking a seat at one of the computers, I boot up the word processor and put my name and tomorrow’s date in the document’s header."

    "This would be a cinch - if only Mrs. Wendell hadn’t demanded we cite five sources…"

    "After about half an hour, I finally settle into a groove. I’ve only got a single page written, but I think I’ll be able to hammer out the next three before curfew."

    "I’m finally getting to the main point of my thesis - that the way Helen Keller was covered in our textbook is woefully inadequate - when I feel the weight of a delicate hand on my prosthetic."

    "Which can only mean one thing..."

    gen "I’ve got something for you."

    #if CaelumLives = False:
    alx "Whatever."

    alx "‘Kay. Gimme a sec."

    "That doesn’t seem to sit well with her. Genevieve doesn’t rake my arm, but she {i}does{/i} pick it up and bounce it repeatedly against the keyboard."

    "My painstakingly-outlined document immediately fills with line after line of nonsense - like a cat just walked across the desk."

    alx "Dammit, seriously? Does it have to happen right now?"

    "This time, the pressure under my temples starts to build into a steadily-oscillating, throbbing pain. Even with the brightness turned down, staring into the monitor makes my eyes ache."

    "Ugh... And we were doing so well…"

    gen "Don't take me lightly."

    gen "I’ve been waiting ages for someone like you to come along - so yes, it has to happen right this second."

    "I guess she’s right, with that inspection coming up…"

    alx "Why? Do you have somewhere to be?"

    "This time, her nails - the same one that dug those gouges in my bedroom - rake angry lines into my skin."

    gen "{i}Yes.{/i} That's the whole point."

    gen "I am a century late to join my mother. You will assist me in doing so."

    "She angrily yanks on my arm, trying to pull me out of the chair. She’s moving so forcefully, she almost dislocates my residual limb from the socket."

            "And then, undoubtedly, I'll just find some brand-new disembodied spirit to jerk me around…"

            "Fuck my life…"

            "Genevieve pulls me into the hallway; for a moment, I think she’s gonna drag me to Jianmei’s office - but stops just outside and looks at one of the old bookshelves lining the corridor."

            "These things are basically just ornamental at this point - row after row of decrepit encyclopedias and other time-weathered tomes."

            alx "Okay, so it's an old bookshelf. Is there a hidden passage behind it or something?"

            gen "Don't be foolish."

            gen "Second shelf from the top. {i}The Odyssey{/i}. Open it very carefully."

            "I sigh, seeing little reason to refuse her. Reaching out, I quickly locate the dusty old book and remove it."

            alx "Oh, gross. This is the Cary translation. Morris is way better…"

            gen "Shut up and open it already!"

            alx "Shooting her an aggravated glare, I sigh and crack the book open."

            "It’s been hollowed out on the inside - the lingering outer edges of the pages are stuck together by beeswax or resin."

            "Inside the hollow is a small cardboard box. Something inside clinks loudly when I shake it."

            "Its exterior is printed with a once-colorful label:"

            alx "Forty-one Long Colt center fire two-hundred grain bullet…"

            "I sigh a second time."

            alx "Ammunition? This is... ammo."

            alx "For the gun your father used to kill everybody?"

            gen "Right."

            alx "…Okay?"

            alx "What does this tell me that I didn't already know?"

            gen "It's evidence! Just hold onto it."

            alx "…Fine."

            gen "Deal with it. I'll return later."

            "Before I can get another word in, she dissipates, her presence departing from the room."

            "Placing the empty shell back onto the shelf, I head to my room and stash away the new \"clue.\" Getting seen with a box of ammo wouldn’t work out much better than getting caught with a gun."

            "Afterwards, I roll onto the bed like a beached whale and just listen to the sound of my own breathing."

            "In a distant room, I can barely hear two of my housemates joyfully singing some pop song I’ve never heard before."

            "I feel tired. Too defeated to move."

            "Eventually, I realize I still have my half-completed assignment on the computer downstairs."

            "Eh. Screw it."

            "Not like any of this matters anyway."

        "No!":
            "You know what? I think I've had enough of this."

            "With all my strength, I forcefully, violently rip my arm back."

            "Genevieve doesn't let go - but she does give a little murmur of surprise, as if she… lost her footing?"

            gen "Have you lost your mind--"

            alx "You know what, Genevieve? Go fuck yourself."

            alx "I don't care what you've been through, or how long you've waited."

            alx "Did you simply assume that because I had brown skin, I'd just be another one of your servants? Piss off. It's the twenty-first century."

            "She pauses for a moment, her grip slackening. I can tell from the look on her translucent face that I've caught her off-guard."

            gen "How cavalier of you. If you even knew how much I've suffered--"

            #If CaelumLives = False:

            alx "You wanna know who’s suffered? My friend. Caelum Bentley. He’s gone missing, and his room reeks of death."

            alx "You wouldn’t happen to know anything about that, would you?"

            "This time, her grip parts entirely. I almost think I’ve ended the conversation right there - but it returns after a few moments, and her outline again materializes into view."

            "Genevieve looks uncomfortable with the subject."

            gen "I… was uncertain. But I did suspect."

            gen "It was the other who killed him. I… my memory fails me often, but I’m certain I’ve never taken a life."

            "Again, a sizzling, trenchant pain feathers along my wrist - and I have to bite my lip to avoid screaming."

            gen "Don’t forget: I still have the power to get you expelled from your beloved academy."

            alx "More threats. Way to reassure me you’re not a murderer."

            alx "Hell, at least you'll {i}get{/i} to see your mom again. My parents are gone."

            gen "…What? False. When you pass…"

            alx "I don't know what that means, but sure, thanks."

            gen "I’ll… leave you be, then. For the moment."

            alx "Fine. Noted."

            "She dissipates, and I can feel the sensation of her hand evaporating on the spectral residue of my arm."

            "I actually won this round…"

            "Maybe I don't have to be pushed around anymore…"

            #If CaelumLives = False:

            alx "But this is {i}my{/i} time on this earth, and you will not arbitrate how I spend it."

            "That makes her dig in more deeply than she has before - easily enough to break the skin, if there was actually any there."

            "I can literally see my plastic prosthetic warping under the pressure."

            alx "Aaaaiiiiee!"

            "Am I free?"
