    #scene opera house

    "WOW!"

    "This place looks a million times better than it does from the outside. Loving the whole ambient lighting thing it's got going on."

    "I hear what I assume to be a generator somewhere in the back, powering the lights."

    "Smells a little funny though, like manure. An odd smell to have in a theater, to be honest."

    "Taking the time to shake off my coat, I notice a bit of color from around the stage."

    "Flowers?"

    old "We meet once more!"

    oph "ACK!"

    "I yelp, caught completely off guard by a voice by the door"

    #sprite Oliver 2

    oph "Y-Y-You AGAIN!?"

    old "Me again!"

    oph "Stalking is illegal, you know!"

    #sprite oliver 1
    old "Sure is. In fact, I'm starting to feel threatened. Should I call the police?"

    oph "What the hell are you talking about? First the park and now here. Don't you have anything better to do?"

    old "Calm down, young'un. This is my spot. What are you thinking, hanging around the city in the middle of the night? Anyone else but me and you really would have something to worry about."

    oph "I don't think I like your tone, grandpa... You think I can't take care of myself?"

    old "Oh, I'm sure you could. Nevertheless, you're trespassing and a lot of bums are territorial. Didn't your parents ever warn you not to explore condemned buildings?"

    oph "That's none of your business, first of all."

    oph "Secondly, doesn't that mean you're trespassing too?"

    old "I suppose. But someone has to tend to the flowers."

    oph "The flowers... You mean, you planted those?"

    old "Even bought the dirt they're growing in."

    #sprite oliver 2
    old "Guess you're right about me not having anything better to do."

    old "By the way, I don't believe I caught your name?"

    oph "And why should I give that out when I don't even know yours?"

    #sprite oliver 1
    old "Fair enough. I'm Oliver."

    oli "Sorry for scaring the daylights out of ya earlier. These old legs don't move as fast as they used to and I have a tendency to stick my nose where it doesn't belong."

    oph "Which time?"

    oli "Hmm?"

    oph "Which time are you sorry for; the park or just now?"

    oli "Whichever one got you the worst, I suppose."

    oli "That aside, you never answered my question."

    oph "You're going to have to be more specific about that one, bud. You're more than a little talkative..."

    oli "Alright, so, again, what are you doing out this late? It's not every day I get visitors, much less ones in pajamas."

    "That's a pretty good question; what the hell am I doing here anyway?"

    oph "Bored, I guess."

    oli "I see..."

    oli "Well, I won't pretend to understand it. Kids have a lot on their minds nowadays."

    oli "You're free to stick around if you like. There's not much to do here either but at least it's dry."

    oph "...Why are you being so damn friendly, anyway?"

    oph "Two minutes ago I was accusing you of being a stalker and now we're holding a conversation like it's nothing."

    "As per usual, Oliver doesn't even hesitate before giving his response."

    oli "Does a person really need a reason to be nice to one another?"

    oli "I get that there are those out there who only think of themselves, but the world doesn't need more of those, does it?"

    oli "What's more, what kind of a man would I be if I chased a nice young woman out into the cold, dark night just because of a little misunderstanding?"

    oph "How valiant of you..."

    oli "I think the word you're looking for is 'tolerable'."

    oph "A-huh..."

    oph "Anyway, why do you hang around in a theater?"

    oli "It's an opera house, actually. Don't let the projection screen fool you."

    oph "So why an opera house? And what's with the flowers?"

    oli "You're not one to beat around the bush, are you?"

    oli "Put simply, this place matters to me. It's like an old friend that never seems to change, no matter how many years pass."

    oph "That doesn't explain the flowers, though."

    oli "Does it have to? Like with any good memories, there are objects that are tied to them. For some it's a book or a photograph. For me, it's these."

    oli "Strange little things; they grow best in the shade and don't need a lot of water."

    oph "Is that how you get away with growing so many indoors? I'm not gonna lie, I don't know a damn thing about gardening."

    oli "Me neither. I had to ask one of my kids to look it up on that goggle thing."

    oph "You mean 'Google'?"

    oli "Yeah, that. Amazing what you can do with technology now."

    oli "Yet, here I am in this musty old opera house every night instead of trying to figure out those newfangled gadgets everybody has now."

    oph "I think it's nice! Whatever shut this place down certainly wasn't because of dilapidation."

    oli "You're right. Simply went out of business a few years back. Nobody cares for plays anymore; movies completely took over everywhere that isn't Broadway."

    oli "I'm rather surprised it lasted as long as it did to be honest with you."

    oph "Doesn't that piss you off, though? I mean, one day everything is perfect and then it starts slowly unraveling until there's nothing left...?"

    oli "Of course it does, young lady-"

    oph "Ophelia."

    oli "Hmm?"

    oph "My name's 'Ophelia', not 'young lady'. You can just call me Oph, if you want."

    #sprite oliver 2
    "Oliver perks up. Must feel good now that he thinks he's broken through my shell."

    oli "Well, Ophelia, naturally I'm not filled with joy over my little home away from home being shut down. But that doesn't mean there's nothing left for me here."

    oli "After all is said and done the only thing that's really changed is the size of the crowd!"

    "So much optimism... I can hardly believe it."

    "He's been coming here for years, even after the shows stopped, and now all he does is garden."

    "How is the crowd the only thing that's changed? This is borderline delusional."

    "It's clearly different now! It can't ever be the same as it was, why bother?!"

    oph "...I don't get you, sir. Like, at all."

    oph "How on earth do you keep doing it, day after day, knowing that nothing will ever be the same as it was before?"

    oph "And all of it over some flowers and a stage... Do they really mean that much to you?"

    oli "..."

    oli "I don't expect you to understand yet."

    oph "Yet?"

    oli "There will come a time in your life when you lose something more precious than anything else in the world. It happens to all of us, you see."

    oli "...and when that time comes you'll be beside yourself with regret and indignation."

    oli "You could spend a lifetime in that state between living and existing, but you'll find your way out when it's your time."

    oli "So while you have the opportunity, hold on to what you have and cherish it while the gettin's good."

    oli "Come tomorrow you may find that everything you've held so dear is just another footnote in the history of your life and you'll need the strength that comes from your experiences to keep moving forward."

    oli "So yes, you probably don't understand it yet."

    oli "However, even an old fart like me can tell you've got a mountain of troubles of your own to deal with. I couldn't possibly know how to help you, or even if you want it without first asking."

    oli "... I guess what I'm trying to say is that whatever comes you should be prepared to accept it and keep living life the way you want to. All hardship will come to pass one way or another."

    "It's like I'm talking to a kid who's spent too much time watching anime."

    oph "I don't know about you, but the only hardship I'm experiencing is the hole in my stomach where food should be."

    oph "...want anything from the place up the street?"

    oli "Now I feel silly rambling on like an old fogey."

    oph "Is that a yes...?"

    oli "If you would be so kind, yes, please. I'm not picky."

    "Smiling for the first time tonight, I direct myself back towards the door and put on my coat."

    oph "I figured as much."

    oph "Back in a flash, Oli"

    "With that, I'm on my mission."

    oli "..."

    oli "...'Oli'."

    oli "I guess some things really never change."
