    "I don't know what to think anymore."

    "There are times when all feels hopeless and nothing is right, but in the midst of it all there's never once been a light shining through to guide me where I need to go."

    "Oliver seems to have found one such light."

    "How do people move on? Is there some trick I just haven't figured out yet?"

    "I could spend hours picking that man's brain searching for an answer to that, but deep down I know it's a solo venture."

    "Gotta figure it out for yourself, Oph. Just like everything else..."

    "I suppose there are worse ways to go about dealing with this stress. Now that I know I'm not entirely alone and that there's a light at the end of the tunnel, I feel better."

    "Rain falls, water rises, but all subside eventually."

    "Like the tide, the flood will recede eventually. It's just a matter of making it through to the end, I guess."

    "...Hell if I know how long that's going to take."

    "Regardless, what am I supposed to cling to once the turbulence kicks up?"

    "Surviving is all well and good, but if I see it through without a damn thing to comfort me once I'm there, what will be the point of having endured it in the first place?" 

    "... Fuck it, man."

    "At the very least I gave a decent reason to come back now that I've had this minute to myself to think."

    "That burger joint was close enough and the chow seems edible at least."

    "...My poor wallet..."

    oli "Welcome back, missy."

    oph "Why the hell are you standing around out here? It's still drizzling."

    oli "I decided to make room inside."

    oph "English, please."

    oli "Some kids barged in and started yapping about rehearsing. Apparently they didn't have anywhere else to go."

    oph "Music at this time in the morning?"

    oli "I don't pretend to understand it either..."

    oph "Burg?"

    oli "Please."

    oph "At least that's breakfast out of the way."

    oli "Nothing beats a warm meal on the cold night."

    oli "You know, I've been coming here for years and I've never been able to go in during the day."

    oph "How's that? I mean, security is pretty lax."

    oli "I'm always busy. Family to feed, friends to accompany."

    oli "My kids are about your age now, so they don't want to spend precious after-school hours with me when they could be spending that time with friends."

    oph "Not to be rude, but they don't sound all that grateful."

    oli "You're not wrong. There are times when I wish they'd just be honest with me about what they do all the time, but I know it's natural to want to leave the nest as soon as possible."

    oli "They're preparing for the rest of their lives. I couldn't be happier about that."

    oli "But it really wouldn't hurt to spend one weekend with dear old dad every once in awhile."

    oph "What about the rest of the family? Surely your wife-"

    oph "...oh."

    oli "Things starting to click?"

    oph "Gears are turning, albeit slowly."

    oli "She used to perform here all the time in bit roles. Every now and then she'd get a decent part and sing up in front of everyone."

    oli "The kids were too young to really appreciate it at the time, but now I can't watch the recordings at home without one of them bawling."

    oli "I don't blame em either. She was a wonderful woman and a better mother."

    oli "A little while after she passed, the opera house ran out of money and shut down. Happened almost overnight."

    oph "That's harsh, Oli."

    oli "Sure was, but I found comfort in coming back for these little visits. Eventually I got the idea for a garden and it's been a nightly thing ever since."

    oli "At first I had to grease a few palms to get in, but the workers just left the door unlocked one day and I haven't seen them since."

    oph "Workers? I thought you said the place went under."

    oli "It did; the owner sold it ages ago. It's taken forever for the new one to decide what to do with it, so they send some hardhats to keep an eye on it."

    oli "By this time next week they'll lay the foundation for a brand new department store."

    oph "You're kidding me!?"

    oph "Damn businessmen ruining everything!"

    oli "I've come to terms with it, Ophelia. Kickin' an screamin' won't do a thing to honor my wife's memory."

    oli "While I'm not all that happy about it, I figure I've had more than my fair share of time holding on."

    oph "But-"

    oli "No buts."

    oli "No 'if's or 'and's either."

    oph "...I still don't get it."

    oli "There's nothing to get. Mourning is over. It's time to move on."

    oph "I don't know what to say, Oliver. I'm sorry?"

    oli "Hah, appreciated but unnecessary. If anything I should be thanking you."

    oli "You remind me a lot of her, clich√© as it sounds. I never imagined I'd meet someone as amazing as her, and now as a relic of our past is slated for destruction, I meet someone else just as quirky."

    oph "I'm not quirky... in fact, I'm downright sullen."

    "Oliver just smiles, taking in the moment and enjoying himself."

    oli "...A lot like her."

    oli "Here, in exchange for the food."

    "Oliver takes the flower from his pocket and offers it up as payment."

    "Having no reason not to, I take it. Gladly."

    oph "Thanks, I guess."

    oph "I mean, it won't fix the hole in my wallet, don't get me wrong."

    oli "It's been a pleasure meeting you, Ophelia, but this old man is far past his bed time."

    oli "Take care on your way home. Nothing that's troubling you is worth your health, so stay warm and away from abandoned buildings, would ya?"

    oph "You know, I might just take that advice."

    "I wave goodbye as he trots off, a small spring in his step not seen before."

    "Whoever the hell you are, Oliver, you've come a long way and come out alright."

    "...So, what's left for me to do?"
