    "For as long as I can remember, these comforts provided me a sole point of familiarity in this alien setting."

    "A fortress - a bastion I can cling to and hold close."

    "But the water continues to rise. Every day, every hour, every second, I remain here; trapped, cast adrift." 

    "I think - no, I can see: the flood has crept up to my bedsheets."

    "I press a hand to them. They're damp, heavy, and cold to the touch."

    "The humidity is insufferable - suffocating even..."
