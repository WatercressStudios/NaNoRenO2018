    "Yeah, that's what I'll do. Maybe I can live this potentially last night in willful ignorance. I can pretend that the night's just like every other night, and that my dreams are meaningless."

    "Walking down the street, I can feel the cold front moving in. It's a nice feeling, refreshing despite the oppressive humidity that follows."

    "My footsteps make a light splashing sound, as the ground is still wet from the last rain we had. A nice reflection comes off of it, illuminating the world around me with the light from the nearby lamps."

    "I pop open my first can, drinking the acidic contents, shaking myself awake. I haven't slept well in a while, and I know that I mustn't sleep now."

    "But, alas, it's still here, on my hand."

    "It turns to me, the antennae on it twitching slightly. The large, black eyes stare into mine, the cute little legs crawling back and forth upon my finger."

    "It's a relatively big guy, too. It's nothing to me, but I'm sure it has some weight to it."

    "Walking over to a nearby light, I hold my hand up towards the bulbs."

    "Launching, it hovers around the light, bouncing between the three orbs. It doesn't quite touch them, though, as I'd expect a normal moth to."

    "The moth stops at the end of the street, having no more lamps to fly to. It turns to me, standing on the lamp and looking me in the eye."

    "It dances from side to side, moving in fluid, yet jittery movements. It's smooth, yet fast at the same time."

    "I take its silence as a yes, and walk up to the lamp, leaning against it. Looking up at the thing, I smile, feeling oddly {i}okay{/i} right now."

    "Having decided on where to go from here, I find myself in a busy part of town." 

    "Holding myself, I struggle to bear the storm of sounds and sights bombarding me. The night lights, the cars, the people, it all makes too much noise."

    "It's compounded by my current issues… my issues of how utterly terrified I am of the future, my sleep deprivation, all of it."

    "It's hard to think about anything, let alone my issues right now, with all of this information."

    "The street ahead of me looks somewhat inviting; a neighborhood, cozy and quiet, set away from the rest of the city."

    "The streets are lined with evergreens, the grass is as green as it can get this time of year, and all of the houses hug each other in their uniquely american way."

    "The moth leads the way, traveling farther and farther into the dimly lit neighborhood. The lights are much more sparse in this area, but the light is just enough to get by."

    "Every once in a while I'll pass a house with some lights on, but for the most part the houses are dark."

    "Every sane person is asleep right now."

    "At least, all of the adults who have their shit together. Living in cookiecutter houses, with their two car garages, families of four, picket fences and all. Well, it's not quite that stereotypical, but it's certainly comfortable."

    "Must be nice."

    "As I continue down the road, the noise of the city dissipates, and I'm yet again able to think relatively clearly."

    "With a contented sigh, I continue down the path, towards my little friend."

    "We happen upon a small park situated in the dead center of the neighborhood. It's nice. Large enough for a good amount of children, but small enough not to impose itself upon the landscape."

    "There are swing sets, slides, an entire playscape set out in front of me."

    "I'm half tempted to sit on a swing, like you'd see in a teen drama. All alone in the dark, thinking about the troubles of a young person."

    "Before I get a chance to do something so cliche, however, I spot her."

    "A little girl. She can't be any older than ten."

    "What's even more odd's that she's alone, and attempting to assemble a tent."

    "...Is she homeless?"

    "No, that doesn't happen in these parts. I must be imagining it. Sleep deprivation must have finally caught up to me."

    "Slapping my face a little, I blink widely, forcing by body to wake up a bit."

    "No matter how much I wake myself up, she's still there."

    "I guess she's the real deal, huh?"

    "With a short moment of deliberation, I decide that I might as well see what's going on."

    "I don't want her to end up getting hurt, or worse."

    "Sure, we're in a safe city, but that's no excuse. She's too young."

    "I loosen up my sneakers, and lay back against the soft grass. The stars above me twinkle lightly, and the light wind brushes the blades against me."

    "Hope decides to do the same, seeming to completely forget her previous task."

    "We sit there for a while, in silence. Every once in a while, I can tell that Hope wants to talk, or at least do {i}something{/i}, but she takes my lead."

    "I hear something light and soft walk towards us. It's so quiet, I barely notice it, and because of that fact, I know it isn't a person."

    "The purring confirms my suspicions. A local cat has decided to join our star gazing session."

    "It walks up close to my head, licking my cheek."

    "Its sandpaper tongue forces a chuckle out of me, and I pet it. It arches its back, mewing lightly, before settling beside me."

    "It's a black cat. Unlucky, huh? Well, I'm fond of cats, so I don't think so. It's little paws knead at my chest, and it nuzzles my neck."

    "I pick it up."

    "Why is it out here? Have you run away as well?"

    "It spots the moth, and prances at it. I jump forward out of reaction, but I wasn't fast enough to catch the cat."

    "Thankfully, the moth was fast enough to dodge it, flying up and out of reach."

    voice "C-201-33.mp3" #Hope (Dani Chambers)

    "It hisses in protest, but Hope has an iron fist on the poor thing. She cuddles it, laying back on the ground, cat on her chest."

    "The cat decides to sprawl out on her, enjoying the body heat."
