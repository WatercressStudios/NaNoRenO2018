    "Having decided on where to go from here, I find myself in a busy part of town." 

    "Holding myself, I struggle to bear the storm of sounds and sights bombarding me. The night lights, the cars, the people, it all makes too much noise."

    "It's compounded by my current issues… my issues of how utterly terrified I am of the future, my sleep deprivation, all of it."

    "It's hard to think about anything, let alone my issues right now, with all of this information."

    "The street ahead of me looks somewhat inviting; a neighborhood, cozy and quiet, set away from the rest of the city."

    "The streets are lined with evergreens, the grass is as green as it can get this time of year, and all of the houses hug each other in their uniquely american way."

    "The moth leads the way, traveling farther and farther into the dimly lit neighborhood. The lights are much more sparse in this area, but the light is just enough to get by."

    "Every once in a while I'll pass a house with some lights on, but for the most part the houses are dark."

    "Every sane person is asleep right now."

    "At least, all of the adults who have their shit together. Living in cookiecutter houses, with their two car garages, families of four, picket fences and all. Well, it's not quite that stereotypical, but it's certainly comfortable."

    "Must be nice."

    "As I continue down the road, the noise of the city dissipates, and I'm yet again able to think relatively clearly."

    "With a contented sigh, I continue down the path, towards my little friend."

    "We happen upon a small park situated in the dead center of the neighborhood."
    "It's nice. Large enough for a good amount of children, but small enough not to impose itself upon the landscape."

    "There are swing sets, slides, an entire playscape set out in front of me."

    "I'm half tempted to sit on a swing, like you'd see in a teen drama. All alone in the dark, thinking about the troubles of a young person."

    "A little girl. She can't be any older than ten."

    "What's even more odd's that she's alone, and attempting to assemble a tent."

    "...Is she homeless?"

    "No, that doesn't happen in these parts. I must be imagining it. Sleep deprivation must have finally caught up to me."

    "Slapping my face a little, I blink widely, forcing by body to wake up a bit."

    "No matter how much I wake myself up, she's still there."

    "I guess she's the real deal, huh?"

    "With a short moment of deliberation, I decide that I might as well see what's going on."

    "I don't want her to end up getting hurt, or worse."

    "Sure, we're in a safe city, but that's no excuse. She's too young."
