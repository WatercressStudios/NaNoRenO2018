    #The Performer route: Begins directly after selecting her zone on the map. 

    #Scene: Street background, night


    "He leaps from the lamp into the air, catching the warm breeze under his wings. One step after another, I follow the lamps, drifting down the dark street, careful not to lose sight of my little companion."
     
    "The city, the sounds, the streets, they all fall out of focus."

    "In this moment, it's just me and the moth floating through the night like feathers in the wind."

    "I wonder if this is what every day is like for my companion? Just bouncing from place to place in search of the light."

    "What a wonderful life, I think. To be guided only by the most basic of senses. Sight, touch, sound…"

    #Maybe an SFX here?

    oph "What is that sound?"

    "I stop for a moment, watching as the moth flutters up to the dim lamp on a small newspaper stand."

    oph "I thought I heard something? No, I'm sure I heard something!" 

    "I listen carefully, attempting to push the sounds of the city aside to find the far away note that I'm sure I could hear just moments ago."

    "Here we stand, silent as can be for just a moment." 

    "And then I hear it." 

    oph "There it is again!" 

    oph "Can't you hear it too?"

    "The little guy flutters his wings in response."

    "Yes, this time I'm sure!" 

    "Music! Someone is playing music!"

    oph "This way, come on!" 

    "I beckon my companion to follow me around the corner." 

    "Over the pavement my humble steps turn to strides, and before I even realize I'm running at full speed."

    "I'm away from the main road now, chasing the sweet notes through dark passages between buildings, the kind of alleys a girl should never go through alone."

    "But I care not. I'm not guided by my eyes, or by any sense of rational thought. Just the music, calling to me through the night."


    "I don't have to turn to know the moth was following close above. He hovers along with me as I go. I'm sure he wants to find the sound too."

    "The air's warm and heavy."

    "It doesn't take long until I'm completely worn out. I slow as I turn the corner once more, where I see the end of the passage in a warm, yellow glow."

    "The sound is as clear as ever, and I hear the sounds of people ahead. What place is so busy at this time of night?"

    "Upon arriving at the end of the passage, I'm immediately overwhelmed by the sight before me."

    "The street's basked in a bright orange light."

    "I shield myself from it as my eyes adjust to what I realize are hundreds of amber bulbs dangling over the road, swaying between the buildings like a web."

    "My winged companion flies swiftly over my head into the array, bouncing between its many layers. Below the lights, the street is filled with people."


    "Adults, really, going in and out of the many clubs lining the street. Most of the clubs have some form of brightly colored sign, with a man at each door allowing people to enter."

    "No doubt the kinds of places I wouldn't be allowed into, at least for a few years."

    "Then, I hear it again - the music." 

    oph "Oh, that's right! Where's it coming from?" 

    "The moth dances around the hanging bulbs. He seems to have lost interest in the music for the moment."

    "That's alright with me, though."

    "I can hear the music clearly now. I watch carefully for cars before crossing the street. I'm now on corner of 12th and Trinity, further than I've ever been." 

    "The sound leads me to a red brick storefront. It's a different sort of place than most of the other venues around here."

    "It's small and dark through the window. Uninviting, as if it's shooing patrons away rather than attracting them."

    "The song is familiar to me, though I'm not sure where I remember it from. But I know it's ending. I have to be quick."

    "I draw closer to the place. 'Dan's', the wooden sign reads. Nothing else, just that." 

    oph "I'll just take a quick look through the window." 

    oph "Just a peek. That's all I want."

    "But I'm too late."

    "I reach the window and peer through the dark glass. It's an empty bar. The few tables have the chairs turned over upside down, on top, though the place doesn't seem to be closed."

    "Past the tables, towards the back of the venue, I see a small stage set against a brick wall."

    "Still further, on the stage, on a barstool, I finally see the performer."

    "A woman." 

    "A gorgeous red-headed woman in a deep blue dress. In one hand she holds a plastic cup, and in the other, the most wonderful instrument I've ever seen."

    "It sparkles as though it's made of pure gold, with a large \"S\" shaped horn extending down through countless bits of shining metal." 

    oph "A Saxophone!" 

    "Of course it's a saxophone. Of course that's the sound I heard, I knew that. I've heard it's sound before."

    "Never in real life though. This is the first time I've ever seen a real one." 

    "The woman takes a sip from her cup. She's paused her performance and is now talking to someone off the stage. Her eyebrows are furrowed."

    "I change my angle so that I might see who she's talking to." 

    "Then I see him. A fat man, partially hidden in shadow, is calling out to her. Angrily."

    "An argument of some kind?"

    "Suddenly, the woman stands up. She puts down her drink on the stool, and grabs a case from the floor."
     
    "The moth perches itself on the door lantern above me. I glance at him, then back towards the performer." 

    oph "Oh, she's putting it away."

    oph "I really wish she would keep playing."

    "Once she finishes stowing away her instrument, I realize she's in a heated argument with the man in front of the stage."

    "I feel sorry for her, though I don't know why. It's not as if I know what's going on, but her expressions are of true anger and sadness."

    "Not at all like the music I had just heard."

    per "...the problem with {i}some{/i} pig headed people." 

    "I can hear her yelling now."

    mgr " Ah, fuck off. In this city, gals like you're a dime a dozen."

    "As they head for the door, I duck around the corner of the building." 

    mgr " Get the fuck out'f my bar."

    "The door slams behind the woman as she steps out onto the sidewalk." 

    per "Bastard!" 

    "The closed door doesn't answer."

    "From there, she quietly turns around, now covered with a black, fur lined coat. She's on the verge of tears."

    "She takes a spot on a bench that looks out to the open street, and places her case beside her."

    "Once again, she removes the instrument and begins to play." 

    "The song she plays now is different. It reflects the face I had seen just moments ago. The music sweeps through me, and I feel as if I know exactly what she is feeling." 

    "Anger, sorrow, longing. All of them encapsulated in the song she plays."

    "My companion flutters over and perches himself on the bench where the performer sits. He lands just a few inches to her side. She doesn't seem to notice, as she plays on." 

    "Watching the two of them in the amber glow, listening to the wonderful melody, all of it is strange. Like something out of a dream."

    "Without any particular conscious action, I take my place in front of her."

    "I can't quite explain why I do so. I don't know why I come out into the open."

    "I don't know why I feel so comfortable with her, as if I had known her for all my life." 

    "I don't know why I move to sit beside her. She's a stranger in a strange part of town, in the middle of the night… and I'm in my PJs."

    "...but that's what I do."

    #She's playing sax on the street. Nobody is paying attention but she keeps going. You approach her and listen to her song for a bit. 

    per "It's a little different."

    "She's not looking at me, but out into the street. People walk by. They don't seem to notice us. Or if they do, they don't acknowledge us."

    oph "...ah ...sorry?"

    per "Experimental, I guess. The song- a new type of piece. You're the first to hear it."

    per "Thank you."

    "..."

    oph "The first?"

    per "Of course. See these guys?"

    "She waves her hand casually across the road in front of us."

    per "They don't really listen. They hear it, I suppose, but they don't listen."

    per "But you've been with me this whole time, haven't you?"

    oph "...sorry?"

    per "Don't apologize." 

    per "You wouldn't believe how happy that makes me."

    per "I've never been one for words. I find that I can tell my stories more effectively through my music."

    per "You stuck around to listen, so, thank you."

    oph "I - uh…."

    oph "...no problem, I guess."

    "She rests the sax against the bench. My companion flutters out of the way to make room."

    "She seems to notice him too, watching as he flew up to a lamp near where we sit."

    per "I'm Daisy, by the way."

    "She looks back towards me, smiling warmly." 

    oph "I'm Ophelia."

    dsy "Nice to meet you."

    dsy "So what's your deal anyway? What's a kid like you doing in a place like this?"

    oph "Hmm, I dunno really. I heard you playing."

    "Daisy sighs, looking at me with a smirk."

    dsy "It's not wise to let yourself be carried away so easily. Though I can't say I've never been there."

    dsy "That being said, it's quite late. Taking a walk on a cold night? No doubt, you've got something on your mind."

    oph "Something… I suppose."

    dsy "Well, you heard my story, so it's only fair that I sit and listen to yours."

    oph "I don't know. It's just... everything. It all ends soon. Everything."

    "In an instant, the thoughts came flooding back to me. The fear. That damn flood."

    "Daisy's face swiftly changes from curiosity to abject horror."

    dsy "Jesus, something's really got you, huh?"

    dsy "I can see it all over you."

    dsy "Of course nothing is forever, but that's fine."

    oph "I don't know… I thought I could run. I thought I could forget."

    oph "The flood is coming. {b}What am I going to do!{/b}"

    "Relief washes over her face, and she visibly switches to an air of understanding."

    dsy "Hey, you ever been to an open mic?"

    oph "What?"

    dsy "It's a place I know of, where you can make a flood of your own, in a way."

    dsy "A place where you can tell your stories freely, without shame or ridicule."

    oph "I uh.... I don't really…"

    dsy "Come on. We'll check it out together."

    oph "Wait! I don't want to get on stage."

    dsy "You don't have to. That's the beauty of it. You can share if you want, and people will be there to listen."

    dsy "Or you can keep chasing butterflies."

    oph "He's a moth."

    dsy "Same thing!"

    "And so we went."

    "Daisy beckons me to come into the building with her. A strange sort of place."
