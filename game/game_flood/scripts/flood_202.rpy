    "We share another round of silence. The tiniest bit of water brushes across my face, a gentle reminder that the summer rain could pick back up at any time." 

    oph "So why are you out here, anyway?"

    hop "It's not like it's a crime or anything!"

    "She says it with a tone of annoyance. She rolls to face away from me."

    hop "You don't need to stick around. I can look after myself."

    hop "I'm practically an adult, you know…"

    oph "How old are you?"

    hop "Ten."

    "With a surprise paw to the nose, the cat manages to escape from the child's clutches."

    hop "Agh, Kitty!"

    "She stands up as if to catch the cat, but seems to give up after only a step or two. The cat proceeds it's chase, mewing up the nearest streetlamp that was holding the moth's interest." 

    "Hope sighs, turning back to me."

    hop "I used to come here with my family all the time."

    hop "But Mom and Dad are both working night jobs now. They never want to come anymore."

    "She reaches into one of her bags, and pulls out a small glass jar filled with long dark sticks of some kind." 

    hop "It's alright though. See, I've prepared for everything."

    "She comes back to me, holding the jar towards me offering me some."

    oph "...Beef Jerky?"

    "I take a piece. It's warm, but tastes fine I suppose."

    hop "The stuff can last for ages, you know."

    "{i}Just how long does she expect to be out here?{/i}"

    hop "Here, kitty…"

    "She holds a piece out in front of her as she approaches the cat."

    hop "Come get a tasty treat, kitty."

    "The cat takes notice and goes straight for it. It seems to forget my little companion in an instant. The cat takes it right out of her hand and lays down in the grass, gnawing at the piece of meat between her paws." 

    hop "See!"

    "She says just a bit too proudly."

    hop "I'm prepared for anything! Take a look!"

    "She leads me to where she's left her bags. A pink suitcase, the kind with wheels, and a dirty red backpack, probably her school bag. She begins unpacking them one at a time."

    hop "Mom was a girl scout when she was my age. She says you must always be prepared, for when you need to survive in the wilderness."

    oph "Yeah for sure. The park is wilderness."

    "I'm actually a bit impressed at how much she managed to pack into these bags."

    "She pulls out two more jars of beef jerky, a pack of cheese crackers, six cans of soda (half root beer and half orange soda), two stacks of cookies, a smashed loaf of bread, peanut butter, ketchup, and a Nintendo DS."

    oph "Wow."

    "She climbs over the pile to where she's got something pale blue rolled up into a tube. She pulls the string and it instantly rolls out into a sleeping bag in the grass, which she sits on." 

    hop "See, I told you I can take care of myself. I can live just fine here. I don't need to go back home. Just like the kitty, see?"

    "She points to the cat, who's come back around, begging the child for more snacks. Once again Hope opens the jar and gives the cat a stick of jerky."

    hop "The kitty lives just fine in the park."

    oph "That's because you're feeding him."

    "I'm not sure what to think about all of this. Obviously she's in no position to be {i}living{/i} here on her own, but I can't ignore that she seems remarkably thorough, at least from a kid's point of view."

    oph "Hope, can I ask you something?"

    hop "Hmm, what?"

    oph "Why don't you want to go home tonight?"

    "I expect a similar non-caring response like all the ones before. But she says nothing."

    "I turn over, to see her lying on the sleeping bag, looking up towards the sky." 

    hop "It...It's better this way, I think."

    oph "Is someone hurting you at home?"

    hop "Oh no! It's nothing like that."

    hop "It's just that, I think for now… maybe it's better that I take care of myself for now…"

    hop "So I'm not such a burden on Mom and Dad."

    oph "Why do you think you're a burden on them?"

    hop "Someone at school told me once that children are the most expensive thing that people can have."

    hop "Some of the girls make fun of me, 'cause I have to wear my sister's old clothes."
    hop "I don't mind it that much really, but it makes me sad to see Dad come home from work. And he's so tired that he doesn't even want to watch the game anymore."

    hop "And I think maybe it would be better…"
    hop "...if I wasn't around."

    "Now it started to make sense why she'd run away."

    oph "Of course you can't just run away. That's your family. Don't you think they'd miss you? What are you going to do about school? What about when you run out of food?"

    hop "I told you I can handle myself!"

    hop "I'll think about those things when I need to."

    "It seems she's not going to be that easy to convince."

    oph "Well, I guess since you're staying here in the park, I might as well too."

    oph "It's not like I've got anywhere to be."

    hop "Did you leave home too?"

    oph "I don't know, I guess I did. I had a nightmare that woke me up."
     
    "The cat comes back to me and lays down by my side. I stroke him gently."

    hop "A nightmare? What about?"

    oph "About a flood, I guess."

    hop "A flood?"

    oph "My room was full of water. It was rising up to the ceiling. I thought I was going to drown."

    hop "That sounds like a scary dream."

    oph "I guess. I think I've just got a lot on my mind right now."

    "Suddenly the cat jumps up, and darts towards the street." 

    hop "Kitty!"

    oph "Where's he running off to?"

    "Hope leaps from the sleeping bag and runs after the cat. Before I know it she's out of sight, back into the neighborhood."

    "She leaves everything here in the park for anyone to come along and take." 

    oph "I guess I better stay with her."

    "I throw her stuff quickly back into the bags and carry them with me out of the park. All except for the tent. That can stay there." 

    "When I reach the main street, I quickly find Hope. She hadn't gotten very far, and was following the cat down the sidewalk past a row of houses."

    oph "Heeey! Don't just run off like that." 

    "I jog to catch up to her, which is hard when I'm carrying her things." 

    "We follow the cat until it jumps on and over one of the fences, into the yard of one of the houses. I get to Hope who's standing outside the chain link fence, looking into the yard." 

    hop "What's he doing, Oph?"

    "The cat walks right up to the porch, and scratches at the door of the house. We watch from the road as a yellow light turns on in the living room, and an older woman opens the door."

    "The cat rushes past her legs and she closes the door a second later." 

    oph "I guess he went back home."

    hop "Yeah… I guess."

    oph "That lady probably lets him out all the time, so he can explore or whatever."

    oph "Maybe he got tired of eating your jerky."

    hop "Yeah, maybe."

    "From behind me I can feel the illumination of headlights. As the vehicle comes up the hill, I hear the a voice calling from the window."

    vce "Hope! Hope! There you are!"

    hop "Dad?!"

    "She spins around. A green SUV has pulled in front of us, windows down, with a woman in the passenger seat. A blonde girl about my age sits in the back of the car."

    ogl "Ugh, get in the car already, dummy. We've been driving an hour looking for you."
     
    "Hope looks to me, with worry in her eyes. But this is good." 

    mom "Hope what is that stranger doing with your bags?"

    dad "Come on now, I've got to be up early tomorrow. Lets go!"

    hop "No...I…"

    hop "I don't want to be a burden."

    "She looks as if she's about to burst into tears."

    oph "Hey…"

    "I say. I put my hand on her shoulder." 

    oph "Look at them. They came all this way just to find you."

    "The father gets out of the car and kneels down to be at eye level with Hope." 

    dad "Why would you ever think we don't want you? Your mother and I do everything we do for you and your sister!"

    hop "B-but you always come home so late...and I…"

    dad "We work late because we're doing it for you!"

    dad "Honey, that's what parents do. They take care of their children. Even when we knew we'd struggle, we wanted you."

    "It seems to be a bit of an emotional moment here so I think I had better go…"

    "I set the bags down on the pavement and try to back away from the scene."

    mom "Hey, you, wait a minute."

    "Crap."

    mom "You had better not be a runaway too."

    oph "Me? No not really...I was just going for a walk when I found her is all."

    dad "Do you need a ride anywhere? We can take you."

    oph "No that's alright, I can make my own way back."

    dad "The city can be dangerous at night. Thanks for looking after her."

    ogl "Ugh. Hurry up!"

    "The dad loads the bags into the trunk of the car. Hope climbs in the back seat, only to jump out again right after."

    hop "Wait!"

    "She says as she runs to the bag, to remove something out of the bag." 

    hop "Here!"

    "She reaches both hands out to me, with something shiny in them. I open my hand and she drops it in." 

    "A compass."

    oph "Hmm? What's this for?"

    hop "So you won't get lost."

    oph "I see. Thank you."

    "She turns around and climbs back into the car, shutting the door. She turns back and waves her hand out the window."

    hop "I hope you get over your nightmare!"

    oph "Yeah kid, me too."

    "They drive past, behind me down the hill, back towards the city. I'm left alone on the quiet neighborhood street. Well,{i}almost{/i} alone."

    "My companion flutters his wings against the streetlamp above. I wonder how long he's been there."
