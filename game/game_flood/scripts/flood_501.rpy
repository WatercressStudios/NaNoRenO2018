    "Forcing myself to stay awake is becoming increasingly difficulty. My movements turn sluggish."
    "The tough concrete looks so inviting. I could just collapse, curl into a ball like a cat, and pass out right here."
    "But the idea of the Flood lingers in the back of my mind. And it's weighing my head down more and more."
    "...Those hated sensations play out across my fatigue mind, like phantom pains needling me further."
    oph "!?"

    "I can't control that the Flood will come, eventually, but I can at least determine it on my own terms. And I'm not passing out in the middle of the sidewalk."
    "...I guess that's it. If it comes, it comes. There's not much I can do about it."

    "Today is my 18th birthday."
    "It's been... surprisingly uneventful. After my late-night adventures, I ended up sleeping until four in the afternoon."
    "Oversleeping like that's supposed to be bad for you, but... I feel better rested than I've been in a long time."
    "Mom and Dad're gonna throw me a party later. It's been pushed into the back of my mind."
    "I didn't dream about the Flood tonight. That sense of building dread, and anxiety, it..."
    "...Well, it... it's still kinda there, but... not in the pervasive, metaphorical and literal sense."
    "After a horrible sleep, I'd just... sit in bed, and vegetate for a while. Today, I just wanted to get out. See some things."
    "The beach is nice this time of year. It'll be a bit before they get really crowded."
    "My eyes lowered on the coming and going tides. The way the hypnotic waves creep closer to shore..."
    "I spot two kids building a sand castle. I've been watching for a while, waiting to see when the tide'll finally come in and wash over it."
    "...They say the water levels are rising around the world, too. I guess that's a more literal flood."
    "It'd be harder to ignore if you had it banging about in your skull every day..."
    "I don't know why I came out here specifically. Maybe the sound of the sea, of rushing water..."
    "Maybe it's a little comforting, in a perverse way. Something I adjusted to."
    "...I don't like that, no. I'm an adult now. I can do anything, right?"
    "There's... too much I could do, I guess. Where would I even start?"
    "I feel like I should've figured things out ages ago, but I got... fixated on stuff that, well, didn't matter at all."
    "What was I doing outside all night? Was there a point? Did I just... need to escape?"
    oph "..."
    "I guess I can figure it out later. It might be easier to; sleep might even come a bit easier now."
    "I met some weird people last night, too."
    "The opera house's getting demolished, so I could bid it farewell with Oliver. Daisy would probably want to see a familiar face."
    "Hope seemed lonely too... I hope she's doing better now."
    "I'll just enjoy the view a little bit longer. I can take it easy."

    "It's weird. Seeing the sunset like this used to inspire so much dread."
    "I guess it still does. For so long, I'd have a feeling that the worst was yet to come."
    "...That could still be true, in the grand scheme of things, but... I don't know anymore. I don't think I {i}ever{/i} knew."
    "Maybe I should feel powerless, I dunno. I guess it's... liberating, is the right word."
    "I thought that, if I put my mind to it, I could do anything. That's what I was taught, at least."
    "I mean, if I tried, I could do a lot of things, but... there's only so much I was ever able to do."
    "I probably can't save the world. Maybe the Flood will come, one day."
    "There was nothing I could've done, but... I can apply myself, in my own way."
    "...I guess the first thing I could do is pick up some trash along the shoreline too."
    "I'll figure something out. I'm an adult. I'm not over the hill yet, not even close."
    "...Maybe, in all this anxiety, there's a tinge of excitement in me too. Just a bit."
