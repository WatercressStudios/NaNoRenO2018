    wai "There. You awake now, sweetcheeks?"
    "I sputter to life, cold ice water splashing down my rosy cheeks."
    "Through irritated eyes, I see a waitress standing across from me, an exasperated look painted on her face. Looking to be in about her mid-30s, bags were already forming under her eyes."

        "Hey, what's the big idea!?":
            oph "Hey, what the hell was that!? You can't treat your customers like that!"
            wai "If you actually {i}bought{/i} anything, maybe you would've gotten the VIP treatment."
            oph "What VIP treatment!?"
            wai "I could've dumped premium, volcano-filtered water on your face instead."
            oph "Oh, that's tempting."
            wai "You want special treatment, go to Starbucks."
        "Nice to see you too...":
            oph "Morning to you too..."
            wai "The least you could do is pretend to smile."
            oph "Can't while my face is wet. It'd cause wrinkles."
            wai "You can borrow my rag."
            oph "I don't even know where your rag has been..."
        "Could you splash me with coffee instead?":
            oph "I need my caffeine fix, couldn't you have splashed me with coffee instead?"
            wai "That'd be 2.50."
            oph "I know you still have the same pot on from an hour ago. You barely ever change it."
            wai "It matures the flavour to keep it on."
            oph "That's a load of...  ugh, whatever."

    "Rubbing my face, I look around my new settings. Aside from the overabundance of moisture splashed upon my person, it's much dryer in here than it was a second ago."
    "Right, I'm remembering now. I staggered into a late-night caf√©. I must've taken a nap at the counter..."
    wai "We're closing soon. You should get packed up."
    "I groan, burying my head in my hands."
    wai "Hey, no buts, alright? I gotta open in the morning too, and I don't need you keeping me here all night."
    wai "'Sides, shouldn't you be back home with your folks?"
    oph "I'm almost 18, I can take care of myself..."
    wai "Coulda fooled me. You look like shit. Don't you get any real sleep?"
    oph "...What do you care about my damn sleep schedule."
    wai "{i}Language{/i}, young lady."
    "The waitress shrugged."
    wai "I'm just trying to look out for you, alright? Go home, get some shut-eye. Dumb kids like you stay up late all the time, and it's murder on your growing bodies."
    oph "Growing body- I {i}just said{/i} I'm 18."
    wai "So? Still growing."
    "She turned her back to me. I stuck out my tongue in turn, before burying my head in my hands."
    "She didn't get it. I could barely get any sort of sleep."
    "I tried, I really did. But every time I do, there's this horrible, nagging inkling in my head."
    #the flood cg sepia?
    "It's always there. The beating waves, the horrible, droning sound of dripping water."
    "The Flood's only gotten worse, and it's filling me with this horrible feeling of dread all my life."
    "Every night, the water rises a little bit higher, and every night I slip a little more into the deep end."
    "What's going to happen if the Flood consumed everything? Would I be okay?"
    wai "The weather's calling for rain overnight. You should go home, before it hits."
    "As she relays this to me, a sinking feeling hits my stomach. My eyes go blank with dread."
    "Oh God... it can't be an omen, can it...?"
    "I can't stay here. I can't go home. I need to think."
    "Hoisting myself from the bar, I give the waitress a slight nod."
    oph "...Thanks, I... good luck."
    wai "...Okay?"
    "The waitress didn't regard me, still washing a small pile of accumulated dishes. I shamble out the front door."

    "It's dark outside. It must've gotten really late."
    "I glance at my pocket watch real quick."
    "...It's midnight."
    "The night is young. How annoying."
    "I can't last like this, I need a game plan."
    "Seeking out a vending machine, I examine their selection."
    "Espresso shots, energy drinks, colas, some high-sugar fruit drinks."
    #sfx loose change
    "Fiddling about with my wallet, I put enough loose change in to buy one of each."
    #sfx vending machine
    "And one by one, the machine dispenses each of them. Thankfully, my backpack has room to spare."
    "I don't want to go back to sleep. I can't. Because I can't shake the feeling that, if I do, something is going to go terribly wrong."
    "I look skywards, and see the hazy overcast of the clouds above. Mocking me with their presence." 
    "The backstreets of the city never looked particularly inviting to a girl like me, and the area's overall poorly lit."
    "Maybe I should head someplace else for the time being. If I get my legs working, I can get the caffeine circulating." 
    "Go for a run. Get the heart-rate going. It's gonna be a long night."
