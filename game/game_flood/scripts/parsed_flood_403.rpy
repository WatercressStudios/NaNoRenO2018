    "I don't know what to think anymore."

    "There are times when all feels hopeless and nothing is right, but in the midst of it all there's never once been a light shining through to guide me where I need to go."

    "Oliver seems to have found one such light."

    "How do people move on? Is there some trick I just haven't figured out yet?"

    "I could spend hours picking that man's brain searching for an answer to that, but deep down I know it's a solo venture."

    "Gotta figure it out for yourself, Oph. Just like everything else..."

    "I suppose there are worse ways to go about dealing with this stress. Now that I know I'm not entirely alone and that there's a light at the end of the tunnel, I feel better."

    "Rain falls, water rises, but all subside eventually."

    "Like the tide, the flood will recede eventually. It's just a matter of making it through to the end, I guess."

    "...Hell if I know how long that's going to take."

    "Regardless, what am I supposed to cling to once the turbulence kicks up?"

    "Surviving is all well and good, but if I see it through without a damn thing to comfort me once I'm there, what will be the point of having endured it in the first place?" 

    "... Fuck it, man."

    "At the very least I gave a decent reason to come back now that I've had this minute to myself to think."

    "That burger joint was close enough and the chow seems edible at least."

    "...My poor wallet..."
