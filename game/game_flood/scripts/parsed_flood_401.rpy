    "Pacing myself, I make my way near the riverside. It's been an age since I last strolled through, but it's quiet here and right now I need time to think."

    "Together with the soft patter of raindrops, the river drowns out the noise pollution of the city."

    "This little bridge is isolated, to say the least. I've been here once or twice before but I can't say I've ever had much of a reason to stop and smell the flowers."

    "At the very least, the hour complements the atmosphere and I can catch my breath."

    "As soon as I'm alone again, all those ridiculous thoughts and worries come flooding back, sticking to me like cat fur."

    "Things like 'Where am I going?', 'What will happen to me?' and 'How do I deal with all of this?'"

    "They're inescapable."

    "The water will keep rising and the storm will surely reach its peak. Soon I feel it'll be too much to handle anymore."

    "It's going to leak out. The dam will break, the flood will wash over everything and I'll find myself without a boat from which to paddle to safety."

    "He's slowly getting closer, watching me all the while. I've been careless in coming here."

    "My heart starts to pound and my mind falters. I stare back at the man as he continues to gain ground ever so steadily."

    "With that, he's gone again."

    "...I really got to get it together."

    "So I take off back to the relative safety of the city, with all its noise... and its street lights."

    scene flood street3 with dissolve

    "Passing through the streets, I feel uneasy. There are so many dark corners in the city with many, many more dangers that could leap out and grab you at any moment."

    "People, feral dogs, falling pianos. Even lightning isn't that far fetched in this crappy weather."

    "At any moment, anything could come around and wipe your existence off the face of the planet. The people I see wandering about all share the same quality that I don't seem to have the slightest clue how to understand..."

    "Peace."

    "This city is a {i}safe{/i} one. I swear I've recognized this fact before, tonight. Regardless, I'm still on edge."

    "These people and their comfortâ€¦"

    "They're all at peace with their situations. Their lives and the randomness of it all doesn't faze them"

    "Or maybe I'm just blind, emotionally speaking. Understanding another human being when I can barely understand myself? Impossible."

    "But then, if we were meant to understand one another, it wouldn't be so goddamn difficult I think."

    "What's more, the longer I spend wandering around the harder it gets to keep going. Rain notwithstanding."

    "Which brings up a good point, what on earth am I doing standing out here letting myself get soaked?"

    "Let's at least try to find some shelter for the time being..."

    "Scanning the immediate area, there's nothing open for business. Not like I have much money to spend just to feel justified in waiting around until the rain passes."

    "Believe it or not, nobody much cares for customers who don't spend money."

    "Continuing to look around while weighing my options, I focus on the shabby building taking up a good portion of the block."

    "At first glance, there's not much to make use of here, but beyond the rusted wire fencing I can see a sliver of light, peering through the crack of a side door hidden behind a bush."

    "For a lack of a better plan, I figure getting a little dirty to take a look inside is preferable to standing out in this mess until hypothermia sets in."

    "Or, you know, getting snatched up by a weirdo."

    "...Right, let's get this show on the road."

    "..."

    "Squeezing through the fence is a piece of cake. Next - the door."

    "...Oh, it's not locked. Well, don't mind if I do~"
