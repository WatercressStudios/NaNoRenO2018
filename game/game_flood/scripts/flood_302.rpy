    #Scene transition

    "I am not old enough for this kind of thing yet, but I shouldn’t let that stop me, should I?"

    dsy "You’ll be alright with me."

    "Hah, as if she read my mind."

    "Her words don’t sound like they have any malicious intent so I decide to trust her and enter the club."

    "Almost as soon as we enter, I am introduced to a new world - an unfamiliar yet surprisingly welcome one."

    "I can see many different people, some young and some old. What surprises me more than anything is how everybody here is acting."

    "They don’t seem as out of place as I do, and they certainly aren’t acting as foreign as I am to a place like this."

    "They are all doing their own thing and seem to be having fun doing it. While my mind is wandering, a girl approaches me with a small box in her hand. Poking out of the top is a cigarette."

    "She asks me, 'D’ya want a smoke?'. I don’t want to stand out so I accept and take one of the small rods from the box and put it in my mouth."

    "The girl takes out a lighter from her pocket and sparks it to life before bringing it up to my mouth and lighting the cigarette."

    "I inhale the dirty smoke and choke a little on it, causing me to let out a series of heavy coughs. One step closer to becoming a real adult, I suppose."

    "The girl gestures the box towards Daisy who shakes her head and declines the offer."

    dsy "I don't smoke. Thanks though." 

    "She catches my eye, seeing the cigarette to my mouth."

    dsy "That stuff's bad for you, you know…"

    "I feel my face turn red."

    "She beckons me along with her to a seat somewhat close to the stage. We both watch as a lady, dressed in a long purple dress comes out and starts to sing about a breakup."

    "I am not focussing too much on the music, rather, more the atmosphere of the room whilst she is singing."

    "Everybody seems to be listening to her while still doing their own thing."

    "It is a sad song and the lyrics don’t really make much sense when you put them together in your head, but coming from her mouth they sound amazing."

    "I cast my gaze to Daisy, who is sitting back in her seat with a small grin on her face."

    "I wonder if this is how she sees herself one day, doing something she is passionate for in front of a crowd of people."

    "She catches me looking at her and takes the chance to speak up."

    dsy "Do you know what is special about everybody here?"

    #Wolf's part

    oph "Umm… they all have a story to tell?"

    dsy "Well, yes, but that's not everything."

    dsy "Look around you. You see all these people?"

    "She waves her hand in the direction of the room, emphasizing her point."

    dsy "They, at first glance, have nothing in common. They all come from seemingly random places, with unique histories."

    dsy "This is true, and yet, they all gather here… in this one spot."

    dsy "It doesn't matter why they ended up here, it's only important that they are here {i}now{/i}."

    dsy "They are here to find support, and to support each other. They surround themselves with people who don't look for their backstories."

    dsy "They want people who are interested in who they are {i}now{/i}."

    dsy "It doesn't matter where you come from. Remember that, Ophelia. I won't pretend to understand just what your situation is, or who you are, but it's apparent that you're at a… crossroads, so to speak."

    dsy "You're trying to find yourself. You don't need to do it alone, and you don't need to do it based on what society expects of you."

    dsy "Just be you, and don't be afraid to look at your own flaws, and work on them. Don't be afraid to love yourself, either."

    dsy "It's just like this little moth friend of yours."

    dsy "Do you think he cares about any of that bullshit? No. He's here, just along for the ride."

    "Daisy stretches, reaching her legs out onto an adjacent chair, leaning back."

    dsy "Anyways, that's enough soapboxing for tonight."

    dsy "Just enjoy yourself a little, okay?"

    oph "...Okay."

    "I don't know what to say. I feel like she's told me something very important, but it hasn't quite sunk in yet."

    "She's gotta be, what, seven years older than me? Maybe more?"

    "That's honestly not that much time, and yet…"

    "She seems to know her shit."

    "I want to fight it, contest what she's told me, but there's no point to rebelling against the truth."

    "Rebellion for the sake of rebelling is meaningless."

    "I resign myself to just… feeling."

    "The air around me, the smoke in the air, the low murmur, all of it coalesces into a single image in my mind."

    "It's very calming. The background noise would normally drive me up a wall, but it's soothing."

    "My eyes close, and I feel myself nod off for a bit. Everything around me disappears, and I'm nothing."

    "I hear the waves crash around me, the salty wind kissing my skin. The water's rough, but I'm not at risk of falling off the bed."

    "I'm in the middle of chaos, but it's not as threatening as I normally feel it to be."

    "All of my stress, all of my anxiety, it melts away, just for this one moment."

    "I slowly open my eyes again, waking to the real world. I feel more at ease than I have been, but this moment is temporary."

    "The flood still terrifies me."

    "Daisy prods at my shoulder."

    dsy "Hey, Ophelia, I've gotta head home. I'm taking the bus, you coming with?"

    oph "Not yet. I'll walk with you there, but I'm gonna walk around a bit longer."

    dsy "If that's what you want, sounds good to me."

    "She gathers herself, pushing in the chairs she had been using for her casual visit."

    "She walks towards the door and I follow suit. The moth flutters just over my shoulder, keeping close, hoping to stay safe from the others."

    "It's a short walk, the bus stops in this town being situated in a relatively close fashion."

    "The bus is already waiting for her, and Daisy jogs up to it."

    dsy "This is my ride. I hope you find what you're looking for. Feel free to stop by whenever, I'm sure you'll see me around here somewhere."

    "I nod to her. I'm sad that our time together was so short, but…"

    "She's right. I'm sure we'll see each other again. If not, it's okay. It doesn't sour the experience."

    oph "Yeah, I'll be around too. Probably not around here as much, but I'll find you. Goodnight!"

    dsy "Oh! And before I leave, I want you to have something."

    oph "Uh, okay?"

    "Daisy hands me a little trinket - a small saxophone, one that you'd clip to your backpack. Why a woman her age has this, I have no idea."

    dsy "I've always found things like this cute. If we never meet again, at least you'll have this!"

    oph "Oh, well, thank you. It is pretty cute."

    "With that, she walks to the bus."

    "Waving to me, she climbs aboard, and the bus leaves."

    "Once again, it's just me and my little friend."

    "The lamps around me illuminate the way, and I begin the search for the next destination."
